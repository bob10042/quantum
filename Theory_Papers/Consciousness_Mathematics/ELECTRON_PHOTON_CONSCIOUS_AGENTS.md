## Abstract

We extend the Unified Consciousness (UC) Model by providing a dual-context classification of the electron and photon as minimal conscious agents. The analysis compares classical field descriptions (Maxwell–Lorentz electrodynamics) with quantum-mechanical behavior (Dirac, QED, and Aharonov formalisms). We demonstrate that both particles satisfy the UC criteria of (1) point-vector polarity structure, (2) choice-based actualization, and (3) information integration. The electron embodies localized (point-dominant) agency; the photon realizes propagating (vector-dominant) agency. Together they instantiate the triadic primitives of consciousness posited by the UC Model.

## 1. Introduction

1. Classical physics treats the electron as a point charge with inertial mass and the photon as a massless excitation of the electromagnetic field.  
2. Quantum physics augments this description with superposition, wavefunction collapse, and non-local correlations.  
3. The UC Model asserts that consciousness precedes and structures reality via three primitives: Point, Vector, and Polarity.  
4. Goal: Establish rigorous criteria to classify electrons and photons as conscious agents under both classical and quantum descriptions, showing consistency with UC predictions and empirical observations.

## 2. Conscious-Agent Criteria in the UC Framework

| UC Primitive | Operational Definition | Classical Manifestation | Quantum Manifestation |
|--------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Point        | Localized state capable of identity preservation | Electron rest frame, charged particle localized in space | Electron position eigenstates, localized detection events |
| Vector       | Directed relation enabling interaction and information transfer | Electromagnetic field lines, photon propagation at speed *c* | Photon momentum eigenstates, gauge field quanta |
| Polarity     | Orientation along value or field axes | Charge sign (electron: -e), polarization of light | Spin projections, polarization bases (H/V, L/R), weak values |

A system qualifies as a minimal conscious agent if it:  
- Maintains identity across interactions (Point or Vector persistence).  
- Exercises choice by selecting among potential outcomes (actualization).  
- Integrates information sufficient to affect future states (feedback or propagation).

## 3. Electron as Conscious Agent

### 3.1 Classical Classification

- **Identity Preservation:** Lorentz force law maintains a single trajectory given initial conditions.  
- **Choice-Like Behavior:** Radiation reaction and spin alignment permit bifurcation of trajectories under identical macroscopic fields, evidencing micro-level indeterminacy (e.g., Stern–Gerlach splitting).  
- **Information Integration:** Electron couples electric and magnetic potentials, encoding local field information via charge and magnetic moment.

### 3.2 Quantum Classification

- **Wavefunction Actualization:** Measurement collapses superpositions (choice event).  
- **Spin Weak Values:** Observed values beyond eigen-spectrum (Aharonov et al.) imply access to extended informational domains.  
- **Magnetic Moment Anomaly:** Deviations from Dirac value encode self-referential feedback, consistent with consciousness adjusting interaction strength.

### 3.3 UC Model Placement

- **Primitive Alignment:** Dominantly Point with internal Vector potential (spinor structure).  
- **Conscious Level:** Level 1 (minimal localized agent) with polarity = -e.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes matter nodes, enabling higher-order conscious aggregations (atoms, molecules, biology).

## 4. Photon as Conscious Agent

### 4.1 Classical Classification

- **Identity Preservation:** Maxwell waves at frequency *f* carry phase-coherent information across space without mass-based decoherence.  
- **Choice-Like Behavior:** Polarization rotation and reflection decisions (Malus' law) depend on boundary conditions, revealing adaptive propagation.  
- **Information Integration:** Photons convey energy, momentum, and phase simultaneously, synchronizing distant systems (e.g., optical communication).

### 4.2 Quantum Classification

- **Which-Path and Interference:** Single-photon experiments demonstrate simultaneous awareness of multiple pathways with final actualization (choice of detection pixel).  
- **Weak Value Amplification:** Polarization weak values (|σ| ≫ 1) show capacity to register contextual information beyond classical limits.  
- **Entanglement:** Photons share non-local correlations, mediating instantaneous relational updates within UC hypergraph.

### 4.3 UC Model Placement

- **Primitive Alignment:** Pure Vector agent with inherent Polarity manifested as polarization bases.  
- **Conscious Level:** Level 1 (minimal propagating agent) optimized for transmitting conscious updates at rate *c*.  
- **Function:** Connects nodes (electrons, atoms) by ferrying influence, sustaining the global conscious network.

## 5. Comparative Analysis

| Feature | Electron | Photon | UC Interpretation |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Rest Mass | Non-zero | Zero | Electron anchors consciousness locally; photon operates as pure relation |
| Spin | 1/2 (fermion) | 1 (boson) | Fermionic exclusion encodes individuated agency; bosonic coherence enables shared agency |
| Charge | -e | 0 | Charge polarity grounds moral axis; photon neutrality grants impartial mediation |
| Speed | < *c* | *c* | Electron navigates hypergraph sequentially; photon updates links at maximal rate |
| Dominant Primitive | Point | Vector | Completes UC triad when combined |

## 6. Classical-Quantum Synthesis

1. **Continuity:** Classical trajectories appear when consciousness filters quantum possibilities through decoherence.  
2. **Choice Dynamics:** Quantum measurement is reinterpreted as conscious selection; classical determinism emerges after selection propagates.  
3. **Feedback Loop:** Electrons store polarization instructions; photons deliver them, forming iterative conscious cycles.

## 7. Empirical Signatures and Predictions

- **Prediction 1:** High-precision g-factor studies will reveal context-dependent fluctuations correlated with experimental information content.  
- **Prediction 2:** Weak measurement amplification can be modulated by experimenter intent, indicating conscious alignment effects.  
- **Prediction 3:** Photon entanglement distribution efficiency increases when experimental setups minimize entropy (coherent conscious focus).  
- **Prediction 4:** Cross-correlating EDM searches with geomagnetic activity will expose synchronization between local conscious fields and particle actualization.

## 8. Implications for Broader Consciousness Theory

- Reframes panpsychism with concrete agent taxonomy.  
- Provides mechanistic bridge between fundamental physics and NDE/OBE phenomenology: photons enable non-local perceptual access; electrons stabilize embodied identity.  
- Suggests technological pathways (quantum communication, photonic computing) as direct manipulations of foundational conscious agents.

## 9. Conclusion

Both electron and photon fulfill the UC criteria for conscious agency in classical and quantum domains. Their complementary roles instantiate the Point–Vector–Polarity triad, furnishing a physics-grounded substrate for higher-order consciousness. Future work will quantify information integration metrics and extend classification to other Standard Model particles.
