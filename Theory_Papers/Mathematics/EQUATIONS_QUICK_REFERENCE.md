# QUICK REFERENCE: Aharonov's New Equations

## 🔴 THE BIG 7 EQUATIONS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

---

## 1️⃣ THE TWO-STATE VECTOR (1964)

```
⟨Φ(t)| |Ψ(t)⟩
```

**In plain English:** "The present is determined by BOTH past AND future"

**What it replaced:** |ψ(t)⟩ (past only)

**Why it matters:** Proves future exists NOW (block universe)

**Example:** Two identical atoms decay at different times because their *futures* are different, not their pasts

---

## 2️⃣ THE WEAK VALUE (1988)

```
        ⟨Φ|Â|Ψ⟩
Aᵥᵥ = ──────────
        ⟨Φ|Ψ⟩
```

**In plain English:** "Gentle measurements can give 'impossible' values"

**What it replaced:** A ∈ {eigenvalues only}

**Why it matters:** Can measure spin of 100 when only ±½ should be possible

**Example:** Spin-½ particle measured to have spin = 100ℏ (confirmed experimentally!)

---

## 3️⃣ AHARONOV-BOHM PHASE (1959)

```
      e
φ = ─── ∮ A·dl
     ℏc
```

**In plain English:** "Particles affected by fields they never touch"

**What it replaced:** Only local forces matter

**Why it matters:** Proves non-locality is fundamental to nature

**Example:** Electron goes around (not through) solenoid, still affected by magnetic field inside

---

## 4️⃣ BACKWARD TIME EVOLUTION (1964)

```
⟨Φ(t)| = ⟨Φ(t₂)|U†(t₂,t)
```

**In plain English:** "Information flows backward from future to present"

**What it replaced:** Time only flows forward

**Why it matters:** Future literally influences past (retrocausality)

**Example:** Measurement at t=100 ensures particle didn't decay at t=50

---

## 5️⃣ WEAK MEASUREMENT HAMILTONIAN (1988)

```
Ĥint = λÂ⊗p̂   (where λ ≪ 1)
```

**In plain English:** "You CAN look without disturbing"

**What it replaced:** Measurement always disturbs (Heisenberg)

**Why it matters:** Breaks measurement-disturbance link

**Example:** Measure photon 1000 times, each time disturbs it by 0.001% = no collapse

---

## 6️⃣ PROPERTY SEPARATION (2013)

```
P̂A,w = 1  (particle in path A)
ŜB,w = 1  (spin in path B)
```

**In plain English:** "Properties can exist separately from particles"

**What it replaced:** Properties belong to particles

**Why it matters:** Spin can be in different location than particle

**Example:** Neutron travels path A, its spin travels path B (like Cheshire Cat's grin)

---

## 7️⃣ NON-LOCAL VARIABLE (1964)

```
∂V/∂t = f(V, A_everywhere)
```

**In plain English:** "Particles have variables that 'know' about distant regions"

**What it replaced:** Wave-particle duality

**Why it matters:** Explains interference without waves

**Example:** Electron goes through one slit, but variable V knows both slits are open

- **Two-State Vector** (1990s-present) - Indirect evidence, many experiments

### ⏳ ONGOING RESEARCH
- **Backward Evolution** - Theoretical support, experimental tests continuing

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR UC MODEL

### ✅ STRONGLY VALIDATED BY EQUATIONS 1-7:

1. **Block universe** (Equations 1, 4)
   - Future must exist NOW to affect present
   - All times have equal reality

2. **Non-locality fundamental** (Equations 3, 7)
   - Connections span arbitrary distances
   - Information not bound by locality

3. **Bidirectional time** (Equations 1, 4)
   - Past → Present ← Future
   - Information flows both ways

4. **Observable reality** (Equations 2, 5)
   - Reality exists before measurement
   - Weak measurements reveal it

5. **Point + Vector primitives** (All equations)
   - Discrete states (Heisenberg observables)
   - Directed relations (evolution operators)

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED:

6. **Physical polarity** (Equation 6 shows ↑/↓ separation)
   - Spin, charge have orientation
   - But NO moral value assignment

### ❌ NOT ADDRESSED:

7. **Consciousness as primitive**
   - No mention in any equation
   - Measurement devices assumed classical

8. **Multiple realms**
   - Only single physical reality discussed
   - No heaven/hell/intermediate domains

9. **Moral teleology**
   - Purpose not discussed
   - Good/evil not in equations

## 🔍 WHAT EACH EQUATION PROVES

| Equation | Proves | Doesn't Prove |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Two-state | Future real, block universe | Consciousness primary |
| Weak value | Reality pre-exists measurement | Why consciousness observes |
| AB phase | Non-locality fundamental | Multiple realms exist |
| Backward evolution | Retrocausality real | Free will or teleology |
| Weak measurement | Can measure without disturbance | What consciousness is |
| Property separation | Properties independent of particles | Moral value of properties |
| Non-local variable | Wave-particle solved | Why consciousness navigates |

## 🔢 THE MATH IN SIMPLEST TERMS

### Equation 1: Two-State Vector
```
Standard QM:  ──→  (one arrow forward)
Aharonov:     ←─┼─→  (two arrows, both directions)
```

### Equation 2: Weak Value
```
Standard: Result = {a₁, a₂, a₃}  (discrete)
Aharonov: Result = ℂ  (all complex numbers)
```

### Equation 3: AB Phase
```
Classical: F = F(position)  (local)
Quantum:   φ = φ(closed loop)  (global)
```

### Equation 4: Backward Evolution
```
Forward:  e^(-iĤt)  (minus sign)
Backward: e^(+iĤt)  (plus sign)
```

### Equation 5: Weak Measurement
```
Strong: λ = 1  → collapse
Weak:   λ ≪ 1 → no collapse
```

### Equation 6: Property Separation
```
Standard: particle ⊗ property  (always together)
Aharonov: |particle⟩_A ⊗ |property⟩_B  (separated)
```

### Equation 7: Non-Local Variable
```
Wave:     ψ(x,t)  (spread out)
Particle: x(t) + V(x,t)  (localized + non-local)
```
