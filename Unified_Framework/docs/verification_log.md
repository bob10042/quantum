# Verification Log

Document every review, test, and audit. Each entry must reference source files, equations, and outcomes.

| Date | Milestone / File | Reviewer(s) | Checks Performed | Result | Notes / Follow-up |
|------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| 2025-10-19 | docs/phase0_foundations.md; tests/verification_plan.md; research_logs/2025-10-19_* | Codex Agent | Linked Phase 0 deliverables to fresh research sweeps; established GR/EM/DIR derivation stubs and test scaffolding | In progress | Populate derivation notebooks and execute GR-001/EM-001/DIR-001 checks; ensure outputs archived in tests/artifacts/ |
| 2025-10-19 | math/einstein_recovery.md; math/maxwell_recovery.md; math/dirac_recovery.md | Codex Agent | Completed analytic recovery results for GR, EM, and Dirac sectors; documented boundary and torsion follow-ups | Updated | Create automation notebooks for GR-001/EM-001/DIR-001 and investigate torsion/Nieh-Yan boundary handling before Phase 1 expansion. |
| 2025-10-19 | tests/GR-001/gr_torsionless_check.py; tests/GR-001/gr_torsionless_check_einsteinpy.py; tests/EM-001/em_flat_limit_check.py; tests/DIR-001/dirac_minimal_coupling_check.py | Codex Agent | Cross-validated Einstein tensors (SymPy vs. EinsteinPy), added time-dependent Maxwell sweeps, and generalized Dirac plane waves with artifacts saved | Passing | Promote automation to notebooks, introduce torsion perturbations, and expand source sweeps before external review. |
| 2025-10-19 | math/gr_torsion_perturbation.md; tests/GR-001/gr_torsion_perturbation_check.py | Codex Agent | Drafted axial torsion perturbation analysis and ran the SymPy automation on Minkowski/FRW backgrounds, linking Dirac axial current sourcing and adding the run_all regression harness | In progress | Extend GR-001 torsion automation with full Einstein-Cartan equations and couple to DIR-001 spin density in curved backgrounds. |
| 2025-10-19 | tests/GR-001/gr_torsionless_check.ipynb; docs/equations_summary.tex | Codex Agent | Embedded Einstein--Cartan solution in GR notebook and produced LaTeX equations PDF | Updated | Use notebook section for combined torsion runs; equations summary available at docs/equations_summary.pdf. |

Guidelines:
- Append new entries chronologically.
- For failures, create issues referencing corrective tasks.
- Link to test outputs or notebooks stored in `tests/` or `math/`.

| 2025-10-19 | tests/run_all.py; tests/EM-001/em_numeric_sweep.py; tests/CONS-001/stress_energy_check.py | Codex Agent | Captured consolidated runtime summary, added Maxwell numeric sweep, and implemented stress-energy conservation scaffold | Updated | Use run_all summary JSON for audits; extend numeric checks and CONS-001 to curved backgrounds next. |
