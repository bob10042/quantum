# Derivation Template

## Objective
Describe the target equation or relationship and why it matters (e.g., recover Einstein equations, derive gauge coupling terms).

## Inputs
- Geometric assumptions
- Symmetry constraints
- Prior equations (cite source files)

## Steps
1. Outline the sequence of transformations or variations.
2. Include symbolic computations with references to notebooks/scripts.
3. Highlight any approximations or expansions (e.g., weak-field, linearization).

## Checks
- State conservation laws verified.
- Confirm reduction to known limits.
- Record automated tool outputs (attach logs in `tests/`).

## Results
Summarize final expressions, boundary terms, and physical interpretations.

## Open Questions
List unresolved issues, dependencies, or future calculations.
