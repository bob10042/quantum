| arXiv | 2025-08-05 | [On the Cartan torsion of Minkowskian product of Finsler manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03165v1) | Ranadip Gangopadhyay | http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03165v1 | In this paper, we investigate the Cartan torsion and mean Cartan torsion of the Minkowskian product of two Finsler metrics. We derive explicit formulas for both torsions and analyze their geometric behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that both the Cartan torsion and mean Cartan torsion decompose additively if and only if the Minkowskian product is Euclidean. Additionally, we provide a necessar... |

These results are obtained by performing a null reduction of four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories on Lorentzian manifolds and the Killing spinor equations that their supersymmetry parameters obey. This gives rise to a set of algebraic and differential Killing spinor e... |
| arXiv | 2019-07-31 | [A worldsheet supersymmetric Newton-Cartan string](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00074v2) | Chris D. A. Blair | http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00074v2 | We construct a (locally) supersymmetric worldsheet action for a string in a non-relativistic Newton-Cartan background. We do this using a doubled string action, which describes the target space geometry in an $O(D,D)$ covariant manner using a doubled metric and doubled vielbeins. By adopting different parametrisations of these doubled background fields, we can describe both relativistic and non-re... |
| arXiv | 2013-02-11 | [Finsler Metrics with Bounded Cartan Torsions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3255v1) | A. Tayebi; H. Sadeghi; E. Peyghan | http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3255v1 | The norm of Cartan torsion plays an important role for studying of immersion theory in Finsler geometry. Indeed, Finsler manifold with unbounded Cartan torsion can not be isometrically imbedded into any Minkowski space. In this paper, we find two subclasses of (?, ?)-metrics which have bounded Cartan torsion. Then, we give two subclasses of (?, ?)-metrics whose bound on the Cartan torsions are ind... |
| arXiv | 2012-04-26 | [Dirac and Generalized Complex Structures on Cartan Geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5951v3) | Honglei Lang; Xiaomeng Xu | http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5951v3 | We introduce linear Dirac and generalized complex structures on Cartan geometries and give criteria for Dirac subalgebras of $\frkg\ltimes\frkg^*$ representing Dirac structures on a Cartan geometry. We prove that there is a bijection between the linear generalized structures on a torsion free Cartan geometry and the equivariant generalized structures on its corresponding homogeneous space. |
