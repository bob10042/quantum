| arXiv | 2024-10-07 | [Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701v2) | Hajime Fukuda; Kohei Kamada; Thanaporn Sichanugrist | http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701v2 | If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we prop... |

N. Machado; Viviana Niro | http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08606v2 | The Inverse Seesaw naturally explains the smallness of neutrino masses via an approximate $B-L$ symmetry broken only by a correspondingly small parameter. In this work the possible dynamical generation of the Inverse Seesaw neutrino mass mechanism from the spontaneous breaking of a gauged $U(1)$ $B-L$ symmetry is investigated. Interestingly, the Inverse Seesaw pattern requires a chiral content suc... |

With the addition of suitable scalars also transforming under $U(1)_{B-L}$, this becomes a model of radiative seesaw neutrino mass with possible multipartite dark matter. If leptoquark fermions are added, necessarily also tra... |

Besides three right-handed neutrinos, that are included to cancel the anomalies (thereby naturally providing neutrino masses), this model also encompasses a complex scalar for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended g... |

Maroto | http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9509227v1 | Using the Fujikawa and the heat-kernel methods we make a complete and detailed computation of the global, gauge and gravitational anomalies present in the Standard Model defined on a curved space time with torsion. We find new contributions coming from curvature and torsion terms to the leptonic number anomaly (so that $B-L$ is not conserved any more), to the $U(1)_Y$ gauge and to the mixed $U(1)_... |
