- **Abstract:** An overview of the related topics of anomalous coarsening and glassy dynamics is given. In anomalous coarsening, the typical domain size of an ordered phase grows more slowly with time than the power law dependence that is usually observed, for example, in magnetic systems. We discuss how anomlao...

In this talk I will review several `condensation' transitions that occur when a conserved quantity is driven through the system. Alth...

I derive those constraints, by maximum information-entropy inference, and apply them to the steady states of driven diffusion and a shear...

- **Abstract:** Modular invariants satisfy remarkable fusion rules. Let $Z$ be a modular invariant associated to a braided subfactor $N\subset M$. The decomposition of the non-normalized modular invariants $Z Z^{*}$ and $Z^{*}Z$ into sums of normalized modular invariants is related to the decomposition of the fu...

- **Abstract:** The conditions of multi-phase equilibrium are solved for generic polydisperse systems. The case of multiple polydispersity is treated, where several properties (e.g. size, charge, shape) simultaneously vary from one particle to another. By developing a perturbative expansion in the width of the d...

#### [19] Detailed balance has a counterpart in non-equilibrium steady states
- **Published:** 2004-08-27T15:55:02Z
- **Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408614v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408614v2)
- **Abstract:** When modelling driven steady states of matter, it is common practice either to choose transition rates arbitrarily, or to assume that the principle of detailed balance remains valid away from equilibrium. Neither of those practices is theoretically well founded. Hypothesising ergodicity constrain...

Conversely, the Drinfeld-Sokolov construction can be used to deduce the existence of commutin...

By way of preparation, a comprehensive discussion of trialities is given, incorporating a number of novel results and proofs. Many of the techniques are closel...

We present measurements of co...

- **Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05740v1)
- **Abstract:** The last two years have seen widespread acceptance of the idea that the Milky Way halo was largely created in an early (8-10 Gyr ago) and massive ($> 10^{10} M_\odot$) merger. The roots of this idea pre-date the Gaia mission, but the exquisite proper motions available from Gaia have made the hypo...

- **Abstract:** The only microlensing events towards the Magellanic Clouds for which the location of the lens is strongly constrained are the two binary caustic crossing events. In at least one and possibly both cases, the lens lies at, or close to, the clouds themselves. On the face of it, this seems an improba...

Such measurements are regularly spaced, and measurement diversity is a good feature for making EPR-steering inequalities ea...

We show that the $U(N_f) \times U(N_f)$ symmetries are only violated by operators of dimension $\geq 3 N_f$. For $N_f > 2$ this implies that the thermal two-point correlation functions of the $\eta'$...

- **Abstract:** We have recently shown that X-ray observations of the population of `low-excitation' radio galaxies, which includes most low-power, Fanaroff-Riley class I sources as well as some more powerful Fanaroff-Riley class II objects, are consistent with a model in which the active nuclei of these objects...

#### [198] Inhomogeneous hard-sphere mixtures: Manifestations of structural crossover
- **Published:** 2005-04-19T11:43:50Z
- **Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0504478v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0504478v2)
- **Abstract:** We study various manifestations of structural crossover in the properties of a binary mixture of hard-spheres. For homogeneous mixtures that are sufficiently asymmetric, there is a crossover line in the phase diagram such that for thermodynamic states that lie on one side, the decay of the three ...

#### [199] Validation of the Jarzynski relation for a system with strong thermal coupling: an isothermal ideal gas model
- **Published:** 2006-07-22T11:40:00Z
- **Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607575v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607575v3)
- **Abstract:** We revisit the paradigm of an ideal gas under isothermal conditions. A moving piston performs work on an ideal gas in a container that is strongly coupled to a heat reservoir. The thermal coupling is modelled by stochastic scattering at the boundaries. In contrast to recent studies of an adiabati...

#### [200] Integrable theories that are asymptotically CFT
- **Published:** 1994-07-19T09:23:54Z
- **Link:** [http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9407113v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9407113v2)
- **Abstract:** A series of sigma models with torsion are analysed which generate their mass dynamically but whose ultra-violet fixed points are non-trivial conformal field theories -- in fact SU(2) WZW models at level $k$. In contrast to the more familiar situation of asymptotically free theories in which the f...
