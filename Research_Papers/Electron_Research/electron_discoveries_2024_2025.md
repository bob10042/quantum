### Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence
- **Published:** 2024-08-15T09:23:15Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044v4
- **Summary:**  Crystalline materials, with symmetrical and periodic structures, exhibit a wide spectrum of properties and have been widely used in numerous applications across electronics, energy, and beyond. For crystalline materials discovery, traditional experimental and computational approaches are time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and accelerating theoretical computations. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic investigation to summarize their distinctions and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in various material discovery tasks. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges and propose future directions. 

### Structural and Physical Properties of the Heavy Fermion Metal Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$
- **Published:** 2025-01-14T06:57:19Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07889v1
- **Summary:**  Strongly correlated electrons at the verge of quantum criticality give rise to unconventional phases of matter and behaviors, with the discovery of new quantum critical materials driving synergistic advances in both experiments and theory. In this work, we report the structural and physical properties of a new quaternary Ce-based heavy fermion compound, Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$, synthesized using the self-flux method. This compound forms a layered tetragonal structure (space group $P4/nmm$), with square nets of Ce atoms separated by Si-Al or Ni-Si-Ge layers. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient of 1.4 J/mol-Ce K$^{2}$, with a reduced entropy indicative of significant Kondo interactions. Below 0.6 K, an upturn in resistivity and a deviation in magnetic susceptibility suggest the appearance of magnetic ordering or the development of dynamic magnetic correlations, which is further supported by a bulge in specific heat around 0.4 K. These results suggest that Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$ is a layered heavy fermion metal, naturally located in proximity to a spin-density-wave quantum critical point. 

### HTESP (High-throughput electronic structure package): a Package for the high-throughput $ab$ $initio$ calculations
- **Published:** 2024-06-06T22:13:47Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04537v3
- **Summary:**  High-throughput $ab$ $initio$ calculations are the indispensable parts of data-driven discovery of new materials with desirable properties, as reflected in the establishment of several online material databases. The accumulation of extensive theoretical data through computations enables data-driven discovery by constructing machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict novel compounds and forecast their properties. Efficient usage and extraction of data from these existing online material databases can accelerate the next stage materials discovery that targets different and more advanced properties, such as electron-phonon coupling for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, extracting data from these databases, generating tailored input files for different $ab$ $initio$ calculations, performing such calculations, and analyzing new results can be demanding tasks. Here, we introduce a software package named "HTESP" (High-Throughput Electronic Structure Package) written in Python and Bash languages, which automates the entire workflow including data extraction, input file generation, calculation submission, result collection and plotting. Our HTESP will help speed up future computational materials discovery processes. 

### Oscillatory Hall effect from magnetoelectronic coupling in flexoelectronic silicon
- **Published:** 2024-02-26T06:25:11Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16330v1
- **Summary:**  The magnetoelectronic coupling can be defined as cross-domain coupling between electronic and magnetic properties, where modulation in magnetic properties changes the electronic properties. In this letter, an explicit experimental evidence of magnetoelectronic coupling is presented, which is uncovered from oscillatory Hall effect response in Hall measurement. The strain gradient in a MgO (1.8 nm)/p-Si (~400 nm) freestanding sample leads to transfer of electrons (~5X10^18 cm^-3) from valence to conduction band due to flexoelectronic charge separation in the p-Si layer. The resulting flexoelectronic polarization gives rise to temporal magnetic moment from dynamical multiferroicity. The external magnetic field changes the net temporal magnetic moment, which causes modulations in charge carrier concentration and oscillatory Hall effect. The period of oscillatory Hall response is 1.12 T, which is attributed to the magnitude of temporal magnetic moment. The discovery of oscillatory Hall effect adds a new member to the family of Hall effects. 

### Discovery of an ultrastable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional CrF3 phase with anisotropic quasi-one-dimensional mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties
- **Published:** 2024-12-26T08:36:35Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118v4
- **Summary:**  We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies. 

### First observation of quantum oscillations by transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields up to 125 T
- **Published:** 2025-06-30T12:20:15Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23779v1
- **Summary:**  High magnetic fields have proven instrumental in exploring the physical properties of condensed matter, leading to groundbreaking discoveries such as the quantum Hall effect in 2D heterostructures and quantum oscillations in cuprate superconductors. The ability to conduct precise measurements at progressively higher magnetic fields continues to push the frontiers of knowledge and enable new discoveries. In this work, we present the development of a microwave technique for performing two-point transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields (up to 125 T) and at low temperatures (down to 1.5 K) with unprecedented sensitivity. This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T. 

### Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals: The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$
- **Published:** 2024-11-16T00:04:15Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10635v2
- **Summary:**  The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research. 

### InvDesFlow: An AI-driven materials inverse design workflow to explore possible high-temperature superconductors
- **Published:** 2024-09-12T14:16:56Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065v3
- **Summary:**  The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties. 

### AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials
- **Published:** 2023-11-08T01:06:48Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04418v4
- **Summary:**  Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties. 

### Diffractive Physics Program at the Electron-Ion Collider's (EIC) 2nd Detector
- **Published:** 2025-01-14T14:23:04Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08144v1
- **Summary:**  The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will be a novel experimental facility to explore the properties of gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and dynamics. The EIC community outlined the physics program of the EIC in a White Paper, and the demanding detector requirements and potential technologies to deploy at an EIC detector were published in a comprehensive Yellow Report. The general-purpose detector resulting from this efforts, ePIC, is designed to perform a broad physics program. At the same time, the wider EIC community is strongly in favor of a second detector at the EIC. Having two general-purpose collider detectors to support the EIC science program, allows us to have cross-checks and control of systematic uncertainties for potential scientific discoveries. The second detector should feature complementary technologies where possible. It can also focus on specific measurements that are less well addressed by ePIC. The second interaction region provides potentially improved forward detector acceptance at low $p_{T}$ and a secondary beam focus that enables to enhance the exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics program. Hereby, I will present potential capabilities of the second detector and discuss studies related to its diffractive physics program. 

### Detecting Thermodynamic Phase Transition via Explainable Machine Learning of Photoemission Spectroscopy
- **Published:** 2024-06-06T19:00:30Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04445v2
- **Summary:**  Identifying thermodynamic signatures of electronic phases, such as superconductivity, is challenging in low-dimensional materials due to strong fluctuations and low probing volume. Spectroscopic methods are often used to identify new bulk phases, but their main measurable quantity -- electronic energy gaps -- is no longer an effective order parameter in low-dimensional and fluctuating systems. Combining angle-resolved photoemission with a domain-adversarial neural network, we report a data-driven method to identify thermodynamic phase transitions solely based on single-particle spectra. We demonstrate 97.6$\%$ accuracy in cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with strong superconducting fluctuations. This model notably compensates for the scarcity of experimental data by leveraging virtually inexhaustible simulated data. Further, its explainability reveals the crucial role of in-gap spectral weight in detecting phase fluctuations and thermodynamic transitions. Our work pinpoints the spectroscopic signatures of fluctuating orders and enables using spectroscopy for machine-learning-assisted material discovery for low-dimensional and strong coupling systems. 

### Electron-Ion Collider as a Discovery Tool for Invisible Dark Bosons
- **Published:** 2025-05-13T18:00:17Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08871v2
- **Summary:**  We illustrate how the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) can be used to discover dark bosons with masses in the $\sim$ (10~MeV -- 10~GeV) regime, having a wide range of properties. We only require that the dark bosons have a non-negligible weak coupling to electrons and decay with $\ord{1}$ branching fraction into invisible final states. Our signal selection takes advantage of the excellent electron beam kinematic measurements and the capability to tag incoherent scattering, as envisioned at the EIC. This makes the EIC a powerful tool for uncovering potential dark sector forces, for a variety of possibilities. 

### Non-Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal
- **Published:** 2024-02-22T13:08:23Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14518v3
- **Summary:**  Non-Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non-Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of surface-selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non-Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, surface-projected density functional theory calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc connectivity and generates new isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the surface-selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk--non-Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non-Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non-Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. 

### Accelerating Discovery of Metal-Insulator Transition Compounds Using Physics-Informed Machine Learning
- **Published:** 2024-03-21T00:55:15Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08653v2
- **Summary:**  Metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials are a useful platform for emerging microelectronic, optoelectronic, and neuromorphic devices, but their discovery is hindered by the high computational cost of electronic structure modeling, the complexity of underlying mechanisms, and the challenges of experimental validation. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates the discovery of thermally driven MIT materials. Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery. 

### Identifying the Quantum Properties of Hadronic Resonances using Machine Learning
- **Published:** 2021-05-10T18:00:23Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04582v2
- **Summary:**  With the great promise of deep learning, discoveries of new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may be imminent. Following the discovery of a new Beyond the Standard model particle in an all-hadronic channel, deep learning can also be used to identify its quantum numbers. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet-images can significantly improve upon existing techniques to identify the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) (`color') as well as the spin of a two-prong resonance using its substructure. Additionally, jet-images are useful in determining what information in the jet radiation pattern is useful for classification, which could inspire future taggers. These techniques improve the categorization of new particles and are an important addition to the growing jet substructure toolkit, for searches and measurements at the LHC now and in the future. 

### Elf autoencoder: unsupervised exploration of flat-band materials using electronic band structure fingerprints
- **Published:** 2024-06-17T18:00:03Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11967v1
- **Summary:**  Two-dimensional materials with flat electronic bands are promising for realizing exotic quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity and nontrivial topology, but exploring their vast chemical space remains challenging. Here, we introduce an unsupervised convolutional autoencoder agent (elf) that operates on electronic band structure images and is capable of mapping band features and extracting the latent space representation as a fingerprint, enabling autonomous clustering of materials with common electronic properties beyond traditional chemical paradigms. Unsupervised visualisation of the latent space then helps to uncover hidden chemical trends and identify promising candidates based on similarities to well-studied exemplars. Our framework paves the way for the accelerated discovery of novel flat-band materials with desirable electronic characteristics. It complements high-throughput ab initio methods by rapidly screening candidates and guides further investigations into the mechanisms governing the emergence of flat-band physics. We believe the elf autoencoder will be a valuable tool for the autonomous discovery of previously unexplored flat-band materials, aiding in the unbiased identification of compounds with desirable electronic properties in vast 2D chemical space. 

### Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors
- **Published:** 2024-06-17T18:00:00Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11951v3
- **Summary:**  Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications. 

### Overview on Efforts for a Second Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)
- **Published:** 2025-09-29T16:13:40Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24983v1
- **Summary:**  The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will provide a unique experimental platform to explore the properties of gluons in nucleons and nuclei, offering new insights into their structure and dynamics. The EIC community has outlined a detailed physics program and the demanding detector requirements in a comprehensive detailed document. The primary general-purpose detector, ePIC, is designed to support a broad range of physics studies. However, there is strong community support for a second detector at the EIC to further enhance the scientific capabilities of the facility. A second detector would provide cross-checks and systematic controls for potential discoveries, while incorporating complementary technologies to address physics measurements that may be underrepresented by ePIC. In particular, it would improve forward detector acceptance at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and enable more precise measurements in exclusive, diffractive, and tagging physics. This talk will provide a general overview of the second detector and outline its potential capabilities, highlighting key areas of the physics program it could enhance. 

### Role of Multifidelity Data in Sequential Active Learning Materials Discovery Campaigns: Case Study of Electronic Bandgap
- **Published:** 2023-10-24T20:33:44Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16168v1
- **Summary:**  Materials discovery and design typically proceeds through iterative evaluation (both experimental and computational) to obtain data, generally targeting improvement of one or more properties under one or more constraints (e.g., time or budget). However, there can be great variation in the quality and cost of different data, and when they are mixed together in what we here call multifidelity data the optimal approaches to their utilization are not established. It is therefore important to develop strategies to acquire and use multifidelity data to realize the most efficient iterative materials exploration. In this work, we assess the impact of using multifidelity data through mock demonstration of designing solar cell materials, using the electronic bandgap as the target property. We propose a new approach of using multifidelity data through leveraging machine learning models of both low- and high-fidelity data, where using predicted low-fidelity data as an input feature in the high-fidelity model can improve the impact of a multifidelity data approach. We show how tradeoffs of low- versus high-fidelity measurement cost and acquisition can impact the materials discovery process, and find that the use of multifidelity data has maximal impact on the materials discovery campaign when approximately five low-fidelity measurements per high-fidelity measurement are performed, and when the cost of low-fidelity measurements is approximately 5% or less than that of high-fidelity measurements. This work provides practical guidance and useful qualitative measures for improving materials discovery campaigns that involve multifidelity data. 

### Automated Discovery of Coupled Mode Setups
- **Published:** 2024-04-23T10:15:18Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14887v2
- **Summary:**  In optics and photonics, a small number of building blocks, like resonators, waveguides, arbitrary couplings, and parametric interactions, allow the design of a broad variety of devices and functionalities, distinguished by their scattering properties. These include transducers, amplifiers, and nonreciprocal devices, like isolators or circulators. Usually, the design of such a system is handcrafted by an experienced scientist in a time-consuming process where it remains uncertain whether the simplest possibility has indeed been found. In our work, we develop the discovery algorithm AutoScatter [https://github.com/jlandgr/autoscatter] that automates this challenge. By optimizing the continuous and discrete system properties our automated search identifies the minimal resources required to realize the requested scattering behavior. In the spirit of artificial scientific discovery, it produces a complete list of interpretable solutions and leads to generalizable insights, as we illustrate in several examples. This opens the door towards automated discovery of scattering setups for photonics, microwaves and optomechanics, with possible future extensions to periodic structures, sensing, and electronic devices.
