### An investgation on the electron's EDM from the electron's MDM

- **Summary:**  We pursue, in this contribution, an investigation of the contribution of the electron's magnetic dipole moment (MDM) to the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) (or the charged leptons, more generally) in the framework of the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics and in a gravity background with a non-vanishing cosmological constant, where CP-symmetry is broken down. Our point of view consist in associating a non-trivial EDM to a non-symmetry of the charge distribution of the elementary particle under consideration. The bound on the electron's EDM published in 2014 is used to constrain the coupling parameter of the electromagnetic sector to the scalar curvature of the space-time in the case we consider gravity to be responsible for the asymmetry in the distribution. 

### Electric dipole moments of charged leptons in models with pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions

- **Summary:**  In this work, we address the impact of a small lepton number violation on charged lepton electric dipole moments - EDMs. Low-scale seesaw models protected by lepton number symmetry and leading to pseudo-Dirac pairs in the neutrino heavy spectrum provide a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses with potentially testable consequences. Among which, it was thought that the small mass gap in each pair of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos may induce important contribution to the charged lepton EDMs. Recently, it has been shown that the contribution from some of the Feynman diagrams to charged lepton EDMs exactly cancel by virtue of the Ward-Takahashi identity in quantum electrodynamics. We thus consider here the Standard Model minimally extended with pairs of pseudo-Dirac sterile fermions and derive the complete analytical formula at two loops for the charged lepton EDMs. In addition, we numerically evaluate the order of the predicted EDMs consistent with the experimental bounds and constraints such as neutrino oscillation data, charged lepton flavour violating processes, sterile neutrino direct searches, meson decays, sterile neutrino decays, and cosmological and astrophysical observations. We find that, in the minimal setup accommodating neutrino data (masses and mixings) with only two pseudo-Dirac pairs, the predicted electron EDM is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-36})~e\hspace{0.05cm}\mathrm{cm}$, at most, which is much smaller than the current experimental bound and even future sensitivity. Hopefully, the electron EDM might reach future sensitivity, once extra pseudo-Dirac neutrinos are taken into account. The analytical formulae we derive are generic to any model involving pseudo-Dirac pairs in the heavy neutrino spectrum. 

### Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory

- **Summary:**  Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP) violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by current molecular EDM experiments. 

### Large Electric Dipole Moments of Heavy Leptons

- **Summary:**  In many models of CP violation, the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of leptons scale as the cube of the lepton mass. In these models, the EDM of a 100 GeV heavy lepton would be a billion times greater than that of the muon, and could be as large as a 0.01 e-fermi. In other models, in which the heavy leptons have different properties from the lighter generations, a similarly large EDM can be obtained. A large EDM could dominate the electromagnetic properties of heavy leptons. The angular distribution and production cross-section of both charged and neutral heavy leptons with large dipole moments is calculated and discussed. The interesting possibility that a heavy neutrino with a large EDM could leave an ionization track in a drift chamber is investigated. 

### Electric dipole moments in the extended scotogenic models
- **Published:** 2020-12-29T03:33:34Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14585v2
- **Summary:**  Electric dipole moments (EDMs) of charged leptons arise from a new source of CP violation in the lepton sector. In this paper, we calculate the EDMs of the charged leptons in the minimal scotogenic model with two singlet fermions, and the models extended with one or two triplet fermions instead of the singlet fermions, taking into account the constraints of the neutrino oscillation data, the charged lepton flavor violation and perturbative unitarity bound for the Yukawa couplings. We show that the hybrid model with one singlet and one triplet fermions predicts an electron EDM larger than the other models in both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. We find some parameter space has already been ruled out by the current upper bound of the electron EDM and further parameter space can be explored by future experiments. 

### Can Measurements of Electric Dipole Moments Determine the Seesaw Parameters?
- **Published:** 2005-08-23T06:35:01Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0508236v2
- **Summary:**  In the context of the supersymmetrized seesaw mechanism embedded in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), complex neutrino Yukawa couplings can induce Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) for the charged leptons, providing an additional route to seesaw parameters. However, the complex neutrino Yukawa matrix is not the only possible source of CP violation. Even in the framework of Constrained MSSM (CMSSM), there are additional sources, usually attributed to the phases of the trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking couplings and the mu-term, which contribute not only to the electron EDM but also to the EDMs of neutron and heavy nuclei. In this work, by combining bounds on various EDMs, we analyze how the sources of CP violation can be discriminated by the present and planned EDM experiments. 

### Electromagnetic dipole moment and time reversal invariance violating interactions for high energy short-lived particles in bent and straight crystals at Large Hadron Collider
- **Published:** 2018-12-02T17:00:28Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00428v1
- **Summary:**  A channelled particle, which moves in a crystal, alongside with electromagnetic interaction also experiences weak interaction with electrons and nuclei, as well as strong interaction with nuclei. Measurements of polarization vector and angular distribution of particles scattered by axes (planes) of unbent crystal enable to obtain limits for the EDM value and for values of constants describing P- and T-odd interactions. The same measurements also allow studying magnetic dipole moment of charged and neutral particles. Investigation of left-right asymmetry by the use of two unbent crystals makes it possible to measure EDM, MDM and other constants without studying the angular distribution of decay products of scattered particles: it is sufficient to measure the intensity of flow of particles experienced double scattering. Spin precession of channelled particles in bent crystals at the LHC gives unique possibility for measurement of constants determining T-odd, P-odd (CP) violating interactions and P-odd, T-even interactions of baryons with electrons and nucleus (nucleons), similarly to the possibility of measuring electric and magnetic moments of charm, beauty and strange charged baryons. Methods to separate P-noninvariant rotation from the MDM- and EDM-induced (T-odd) spin rotations are discussed. 

### Determination of the sensitivity of $??$ and $??^+_c$ electric dipole moments using a full angular analysis
- **Published:** 2025-07-25T08:19:03Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19056v2
- **Summary:**  A search for a non-zero Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of particles, which is a clear signal of a violation of CP symmetry, is one of the unique ways to discover physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we discuss a method for determining the EDM of baryons from the full angular distribution of final particles in electron-positron pair annihilation processes. The question of how accurately the state-of-the-art experiments can determine EDM of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons is discussed in detail. Investigating the pseudo-statistics that corresponds to the BESIII experiment, the estimated sensitivity for $\Lambda$ EDM is obtained at the level of $10^{-18}$ $e\,$cm. The similar figure for the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) experiment is found to be of the order of $10^{-20}$ $e\,$cm. For the $\Lambda_c^+$ EDM, the calculated sensitivity for the STCF experiment is $10^{-16}$ $e\,$cm. The case of a polarized initial electron is considered separately as such an option is planned at the STCF experiment. 

### Perturbative QCD Prediction of the Hyperon EDM from CP-violating Dipole Interactions
- **Published:** 2025-09-26T09:10:13Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22087v2
- **Summary:**  Electric dipole moment (EDM) of baryons provides a sensitive probe of CP-violating interactions beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by the recent BESIII measurement on the $\Lambda$-hyperon EDM [1], we present the first perturbative QCD analysis of the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to elucidate its origin in CP-violating quark dipole interactions. In particular, we derive a QCD factorization formula that relates the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to quark EDMs and chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) through convolutions with the light-cone distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$. These connections allow us to extract constraints on CP-violating dipole couplings from current and future hyperon EDM measurements. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the $\Lambda$ EDM exhibits unique sensitivity to the strange-quark CEDM, providing complementary information to that obtained from the neutron EDM. 

### Reevaluation of heavy-fermion-induced electron EDM at three loops
- **Published:** 2022-07-04T19:12:12Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01679v1
- **Summary:**  Motivated by improved limits on electric dipole moments (EDMs), we revisit the three-loop light-by-light mechanism that transmits $CP$ violation from a heavy fermion to a light one. Applying it to the electron EDM induced by EDMs of heavier flavors, we find additional contributions at the order $ m_e/m_\mu $ or $m_e/m_\tau$ that were missing before and that make the result 1.4 times larger. Consequently we improve bounds on the tau EDM, and update indirect limits on the muon EDM as well as charm and bottom quark color EDMs. 

### STIRAP preparation of a coherent superposition of ThO $H^3??_1$ states for an improved electron EDM measurement
- **Published:** 2016-03-24T18:59:44Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07707v1
- **Summary:**  Experimental searches for the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. The current best EDM limit was set by the ACME Collaboration [Science \textbf{343}, 269 (2014)], constraining time reversal symmetry ($T$) violating physics at the TeV energy scale. ACME used optical pumping to prepare a coherent superposition of ThO $H^3\Delta_1$ states that have aligned electron spins. Spin precession due to the molecule's internal electric field was measured to extract the EDM. We report here on an improved method for preparing this spin-aligned state of the electron by using STIRAP. We demonstrate a transfer efficiency of $75\pm5\%$, representing a significant gain in signal for a next generation EDM experiment. We discuss the particularities of implementing STIRAP in systems such as ours, where molecular ensembles with large phase-space distributions are transfered via weak molecular transitions with limited laser power and limited optical access. 

### Intrinsic Electric Dipole Moments of Paramagnetic Atoms: Rubidium and Cesium
- **Published:** 2008-04-07T09:43:18Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0998v1
- **Summary:**  The electric dipole moment (EDM) of paramagnetic atoms is sensitive to the intrinsic EDM contribution from that of its constituent electrons and a scalar--pseudo-scalar (S-PS) electron-nucleus interactions. The electron EDM and the S-PS EDM contribution to atomic EDM scales as Z^3. Thus, the heavy paramagnetic atomic systems will exhibit large enhancement factors. However, the nature of the coupling is so small that it becomes an interest of high precision atomic experiments. In this work, we have computed the EDM enhancement factors of the ground states of Rb and Cs due to both the electron EDM and the S-PS EDM using the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. The importance of obtaining the precise enhancement factors and the experimental results in deducing a reliable limit on the electron EDM is emphasized. 

### Screening of nucleon electric dipole moments in atomic systems
- **Published:** 2020-08-09T07:08:57Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03678v3
- **Summary:**  The electric dipole moments (EDMs) of diamagnetic atoms are expected to be sensitive to charge-parity violation particularly in nuclei through the nuclear Schiff moment. I explicitly demonstrate that the well-known form of the Schiff moment operator originating from the nucleon EDM is obtained by considering the screening of the nucleon EDMs in a neutral atom. Consequently, an additional contribution to the Schiff moment arises from the screening of the nuclear EDM induced by the interaction of the nucleon EDMs with the protons. This correction to the Schiff moment of $^{199}$Hg is evaluated in the independent particle model. 

### Electric Dipole Moments of Charged Leptons from Their Majorana-type Yukawa Couplings
- **Published:** 2008-12-23T01:40:45Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4324v2
- **Summary:**  The electric dipole moments (EDMs) of charged leptons are significantly suppressed in standard model. It has been found previously that they are even more severely suppressed in seesaw type models by powers of tiny neutrino masses as far as a leptonic CP source is concerned. We investigate whether a Majorana-type Yukawa coupling between charged leptons and a doubly charged scalar can contribute significantly to their EDMs. An observable EDM would then help unravel the Majorana nature of neutrinos by a lepton number conserving quantity. We find that the EDMs are indeed parametrically large, of the form d_\alpha\propto em_\alpha(m^2_\beta-m^2_\gamma)/m^4 up to logarithms, where m_\alpha and m are respectively the masses of charged leptons and the scalar. And they satisfy a sum rule to good precision, d_e/m_e+d_\mu/m_\mu+d_\tau/m_\tau=0. With the most stringent constraints from lepton flavor violating transitions taken into account, their values are still much larger than the mentioned previous results. Unfortunately, even in the most optimistic case the electron EDM is about three orders of magnitude below the foreseeable experimental sensitivity. 

### Oscillating nuclear electric dipole moment induced by axion dark matter produces atomic and molecular EDM
- **Published:** 2019-04-16T11:51:24Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07609v3
- **Summary:**  According to the Schiff theorem nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) is completely shielded in a neutral atom by electrons. This makes a static nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) unobservable. Interaction with the axion dark matter field generates nuclear EDM $d=d_0 \cos (\omega t)$ oscillating with the frequency $\omega= m_a c^2/\hbar$ . This EDM generates atomic EDM proportional to $\omega^2$. This effect is strongly enhanced in molecules since nuclei move slowly and do not produce as efficient screening of oscillating nuclear EDM as electrons do. An additional strong enhancement comes due to a small energy interval between rotational molecular levels. Finally, if the nuclear EDM oscillation frequency is in resonance with a molecular transition, there may be a significant resonance enhancement.
