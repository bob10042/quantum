### Alignment of the straw tracking detectors for the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment and systematic studies for a muon electric dipole moment measurement

- **Summary:**  The Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment is currently preparing for its fourth data-taking period (Run-4). The experiment-wide effort on the analysis of Run-1 data is nearing completion, with the announcement of the first result expected in the coming months. The final goal of the experiment is to determine the muon magnetic anomaly to a precision of 140 ppb. This level of precision will provide indirect evidence of new physics, if the central value agrees with the previously-measured value of the magnetic anomaly. Essential in reducing the systematic uncertainty, through measurements of the muon beam profile, are the in-vacuum straw tracking detectors. A crucial prerequisite in obtaining accurate distributions of the beam profile is the internal alignment of the tracking detectors, which is described in this thesis. As a result of this position calibration, the tracking efficiency has increased by 3%, while the track quality increased by 4%. This thesis also discusses an additional measurement that will be made using the tracking detectors: a search for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon, through the direct detection of an oscillation in the average vertical angle of the electron from the muon decay. An observation of a muon EDM would be evidence of new physics and would provide a new source of CP violation in the charged lepton sector. Essential in measuring the EDM are accurate and precise estimations of potential non-zero radial and longitudinal magnetic fields, which were estimated using the Run-1 data. In addition, a preliminary analysis using the Run-1 data was undertaken to estimate the available precision for the magnetic anomaly measurement using the tracking detectors. 

### Testing the $a_??$ anomaly in the electron sector through a precise measurement of $h/M$

- **Summary:**  The persistent $a_\mu \equiv (g-2)/2$ anomaly in the muon sector could be due to new physics visible in the electron sector through a sub-ppb measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron $a_e$. Driven by recent results on the electron mass (S. Sturm et al., Nature 506 (2014) 467), we reconsider the sources of uncertainties that limit our knowledge of $a_e$ including current advances in atom interferometry. We demonstrate that it is possible to attain the level of precision needed to test $a_\mu$ in the naive scaling hypothesis on a timescale similar to next generation $g-2$ muon experiments at Fermilab and JPARC. In order to achieve such level of precision, the knowledge of the quotient $h/M$, i.e. the ratio between the Planck constant and the mass of the atom employed in the interferometer, will play a crucial role. We identify the most favorable isotopes to achieve an overall relative precision below $10^{-10}$. 

### Magnetic structure, magnetoelastic coupling, and thermal properties of EuCrO$_3$ nano-powders

- **Summary:**  We carried out detailed studies of the magnetic structure, magnetoelastic coupling, and thermal properties of EuCrO$_3$ nano-powders from room temperature to liquid helium temperature. Our neutron powder diffraction and X-ray powder diffraction measurements provide precise atomic positions of all atoms in the cell, especially for the light oxygen atoms. The low-temperature neutron powder diffraction data revealed extra Bragg peaks of magnetic origin which can be attributed to a $G_x$ antiferromagnetic structure with an ordered moment of $\sim$ 2.4 $\mu_{\rm B}$ consistent with the $3d^3$ electronic configuration of the Cr$^{3+}$ cations. Apart from previously reported antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transitions in EuCrO$_3$ at low temperatures, we also observed an anomaly at about 100 K. This anomaly was observed in temperature dependence of sample's, lattice parameters, thermal expansion, Raman spectroscopy, permittivity and conductance measurements. This anomaly is attributed to the magnetoelastic distortion in the EuCrO$_3$ crystal. 

### Leptonic $g-2$ anomaly in an extended Higgs sector with vector-like leptons
- **Published:** 2021-09-06T16:28:45Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02586v2
- **Summary:**  We address the observed discrepancies in the anomalous magnetic dipole moments (MDM) of the muon and electron by extending the inert two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with SM gauge singlet complex scalar field and singlet Vector-like Lepton (VLL) field. We obtain the allowed parameter space constrained from the Higgs decays to gauge Bosons at LHC, LEP II data and electro-weak precision measurements. The muon and electron MDM's are then explained within a common parameter space for different sets of allowed couplings and masses of the model particles. 

### Measured Lepton Magnetic Moments

- **Summary:**  The electron and muon magnetic moment have played, and continue to play, important roles in testing the fundamental mathematical description of physical reality called the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring. The extremely high precision of the electron and muon magnetic moment measurements has driven major advances in theoretical physics, inspiring new techniques in quantum field theory, precision calculations, and lattice gauge theory. Only experimental limits currently exist on the size of the magnetic moments of the tau and neutrino leptons. 

### A light complex scalar for the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments
- **Published:** 2018-10-25T18:00:03Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11028v2
- **Summary:**  The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon are interesting observables, since they can be measured with great precision and their values can be computed with excellent accuracy within the Standard Model (SM). The current experimental measurement of this quantities show a deviation of a few standard deviations with respect to the SM prediction, which may be a hint of new physics. The fact that the electron and the muon masses differ by two orders of magnitude and the deviations have opposite signs makes it difficult to find a common origin of these anomalies. In this work we introduce a complex singlet scalar charged under a Peccei-Quinn-like (PQ) global symmetry together with the electron transforming chirally under the same symmetry. In this realization, the CP-odd scalar couples to electron only, while the CP-even part can couple to muons and electrons simultaneously. In addition, the CP-odd scalar can naturally be much lighter than the CP-even scalar, as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of the PQ-like symmetry, leading to an explanation of the suppression of the electron anomalous magnetic moment with respect to the SM prediction due to the CP-odd Higgs effect dominance, as well as an enhancement of the muon one induced by the CP-even component. 

### Precision Muonium Spectroscopy

- **Summary:**  The muonium atom is the purely leptonic bound state of a positive muon and an electron. It has a lifetime of 2.2 $\mu$s. The absence of any known internal structure provides for precision experiments to test fundamental physics theories and to determine accurate values of fundamental constants. In particular groun dstate hyperfine structure transitions can be measured by microwave spectroscopy to deliver the muon magnetic moment. The frequency of the 1s-2s transition in the hydrogen-like atom can be determined with laser spectroscopy to obtain the muon mass. With such measurements fundamental physical interactions, in particular Quantum Electrodynamics, can also be tested at highest precision. The results are important input parameters for experiments on the muon magnetic anomaly. The simplicity of the atom enables further precise experiments, such as a search for muonium-antimuonium conversion for testing charged lepton number conservation and searches for possible antigravity of muons and dark matter. 

### Study of magnetic and specific heat measurements at low temperatures in Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 and Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3
- **Published:** 2001-05-29T18:02:44Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0105571v1
- **Summary:**  The magnetization at low temperatures for Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 and Nd0.5Ca0.5MnO3 samples showed a rapid increase with decreasing temperatures, contrary to a La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 sample. Specific heat measurement at low temperatures showed a Schottky-like anomaly for the first two samples. However, there is not a straight forward correlation between the intrinsic magnetic moment of the Nd3+ ions and the Schottky-like anomaly. 

### MUonE sensitivity to new physics explanations of the muon anomalous magnetic moment
- **Published:** 2020-02-12T07:11:02Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04822v2
- **Summary:**  The MUonE experiment aims at a precision measurement of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$, via elastic muon-electron scattering. Since the current muon $g-2$ anomaly hints at the potential existence of new physics (NP) related to the muon, the question then arises as to whether the measurement of hadronic vacuum polarization in MUonE could be affected by the same NP as well. In this work, we address this question by investigating a variety of NP explanations of the muon $g-2$ anomaly via either vector or scalar mediators with either flavor-universal, non-universal or even flavor-violating couplings to electrons and muons. We derive the corresponding MUonE sensitivity in each case and find that the measurement of hadronic vacuum polarization at the MUonE is not vulnerable to any of these NP scenarios. 

### Searching for New Physics Through AMO Precision Measurements
- **Published:** 2012-08-22T14:26:44Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4506v1
- **Summary:**  We briefly review recent experiments in atomic, molecular, and optical physics using precision measurements to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. We consider three main categories of experiments: searches for changes in fundamental constants, measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, and searches for an electric dipole moment of the electron. 

### Calculation of hyperfine magnetic anomaly in many-electron atoms
- **Published:** 2020-04-25T07:51:49Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12078v1
- **Summary:**  The precision measurements of the ratio of hyperfine structure constants for $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ states allow us to estimate the difference between hyperfine magnetic anomalies for these levels. We calculate the atomic factor in order to recover the absolute values of the hyperfine magnetic anomalies from their difference. Taking into account the hyperfine anomaly correction allows one to increase the accuracy of determining the g-factors of short-lived isotopes by more than an order of magnitude. 

### Low temperature magnetic properties of Nd2Ru2O7
- **Published:** 2018-03-20T11:05:01Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07363v1
- **Summary:**  We present magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction measurements of polycrystalline Nd2Ru2O7 down to 0.4 K. Three anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility measurements at 146, 21 and 1.8 K are associated with an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ru4+ moments, a weak ferromagnetic signal attributed to a canting of the Ru4+ and Nd3+ moments, and a long-range-ordering of the Nd3+ moments, respectively. The long-range order of the Nd3+ moments was observed in all the measurements, indicating that the ground state of the compound is not a spin glass. The magnetic entropy of Rln2 accumulated up to 5 K, suggests the Nd3+ has a doublet ground state. Lattice distortions accompany the transitions, as revealed by neutron diffraction measurements, and in agreement with earlier synchrotron x-ray studies. The magnetic moment of the Nd3+ ion at 0.4 K is estimated to be 1.54(2){\mu}B and the magnetic structure is all-in all-out as determined by our neutron diffraction measurements. 

### General relativity experiment with frozen spin rings
- **Published:** 2019-01-18T13:19:30Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06217v1
- **Summary:**  In experimental proposals published in the last two decades, a so called frozen spin storage ring concept was proposed for setting upper experimental bounds to electric dipole moment (EDM) of elementary particles. In a recent paper of ours, a fully covariant general relativistic (GR) calculation was presented on the Earth's gravitational modification effect in such mixed magnetic-electric frozen spin storage ring on the spin transport, which could contribute to such measurement. It was shown that similarly to an EDM signal, GR causes a spin precession out of the orbital plane, under the frozen spin condition. The rate of the vertical polarization buildup is predicted to be -a*beta*gamma*g/c, where g is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the Earth, c is the speed of light, beta*gamma is the particle momentum over mass, and 'a' is its magnetic moment anomaly. It is seen that the effect increases unboundedly with the Lorentz factor gamma. Moreover, it is proportional to the magnetic moment anomaly 'a'. This paper mainly addresses the experimental perspectives to detect this effect in a realistic frozen spin storage ring configuration. Such a measurement would provide a novel test of GR, sampling the tensorial nature of GR at a microscopic level, as acting on the spin vector of elementary particles. The conclusion is that the pertinent GR experiment seems to be realistic with large magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as tritons, helion3 or protons, whereas it is not realistic with small magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as deuterons, muons or electrons. 

### Neutrino Electromagnetic Properties and the Weak Mixing Angle at the LHC Forward Physics Facility
- **Published:** 2023-01-24T19:00:01Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10254v2
- **Summary:**  The LHC produces an intense beam of highly energetic neutrinos of all three flavors in the forward direction, and the Forward Physics Facility (FPF) has been proposed to house a suite of experiments taking advantage of this opportunity. In this study, we investigate the FPF's potential to probe the neutrino electromagnetic properties, including neutrino millicharge, magnetic moment, and charge radius. We find that, due to the large flux of tau neutrinos at the LHC, the FPF detectors will be able to provide more sensitive constraints on the tau neutrino magnetic moment and millicharge than previous measurements at DONUT, by searching for excess in low recoil energy electron scattering events. We also find that, by precisely measuring the rate of neutral current deep inelastic scattering events, the FPF detectors have the potential to obtain the strongest experimental bounds on the neutrino charge radius for the electron neutrino, and one of the leading bounds for the muon neutrino flavor. The same signature could also be used to measure the weak mixing angle, and we estimate that $\sin^2 \theta_W$ could be measured to about $3\%$ precision at a scale $Q \sim 10$ GeV, shedding new light on the longstanding NuTeV anomaly. 

### Interaction-driven giant orbital magnetic moments in carbon nanotubes
- **Published:** 2018-09-21T23:48:28Z
- **Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08347v1
- **Summary:**  Carbon nanotubes continue to be model systems for studies of confinement and interactions. This is particularly true in the case of so-called "ultra-clean" carbon nanotube devices offering the study of quantum dots with extremely low disorder. The quality of such systems, however, has increasingly revealed glaring discrepancies between experiment and theory. Here we address the outstanding anomaly of exceptionally large orbital magnetic moments in carbon nanotube quantum dots. We perform low temperature magneto-transport measurements of the orbital magnetic moment and find it is up to seven times larger than expected from the conventional semiclassical model. Moreover, the magnitude of the magnetic moment monotonically drops with the addition of each electron to the quantum dot directly contradicting the widely accepted shell filling picture of single-particle levels. We carry out quasiparticle calculations, both from first principles and within the effective-mass approximation, and find the giant magnetic moments can only be captured by considering a self-energy correction to the electronic band structure due to electron-electron interactions.
