## 📝 QUICK REFERENCE: KEY QUOTES

### From Aharonov Interview:

> "How could we have been so wrong for so long about quantum mechanics... all the things that we are told about quantum mechanics is wrong"

> "In order to describe fully the present... you must do two experiments - one before that give you a one boundary condition from the past... and later you do another experiment... that new thing... is propagated back from the future to the present"

> "The electron even though it moves at one point has another variable that will tell the electron later where to appear... and that variable has non local equations of motion"

> "What is really there are observables that are functions of position momentum... the wave is only a mathematical way to solve the problem but it does not show what is really there"

### From UC Model:

> "Time is not fundamental but emergent from consciousness's actualization process"

> "From outside time (Core's view): Complete static object. From inside time (embodied consciousness): Open future being created through choice"

> "The structure contains all possibilities; consciousness actualizes one experiential path"

> "Brain normally: Filters out V_core, V_realms, V_parallel. Psychedelics: Suppress filtering mechanisms. Result: Direct perception of deeper network layers"
