# NEW EQUATIONS FROM AHARONOV'S WORK: Detailed Explanation

## What Makes These "New"?

These equations either:
1. **Did not exist before** in any form
2. **Fundamentally changed** how we understand quantum mechanics
3. **Revealed new phenomena** that standard QM couldn't explain

---

# EQUATION 1: THE TWO-STATE VECTOR (1964)

## The Equation

```
Complete quantum state at time t:

    Ω(t) = ⟨Φ(t)| |Ψ(t)⟩
```

## What Existed Before

**Standard quantum mechanics (1925-1964):**
```
State = |ψ(t)⟩

Evolution: |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iĤt/ℏ)|ψ(0)⟩
```

Only forward evolution from past.

## What Aharonov Added

```
Forward piece:  |Ψ(t)⟩ = U(t,t₁)|Ψ(t₁)⟩
Backward piece: ⟨Φ(t)| = ⟨Φ(t₂)|U†(t₂,t)

Combined: ⟨Φ(t)| |Ψ(t)⟩
```

The backward-evolving state ⟨Φ(t)| is **completely new**.

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"The present is determined by BOTH the past AND the future."**

### Physical Meaning:
To fully describe a quantum system RIGHT NOW, you need:
- What happened before (|Ψ⟩)
- What will happen later (⟨Φ|)

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Standard QM: State space = {|ψ⟩}  [vectors]
TSVF:        State space = {⟨φ| |ψ⟩}  [dual vectors]
```

Doubled the mathematical structure.

## Concrete Example

**Two radioactive atoms:**

Standard QM says:
```
Atom A: |ψₐ⟩ = |excited⟩
Atom B: |ψᵦ⟩ = |excited⟩  [Identical!]

Cannot explain why one decays at t=1s, other at t=1000s
```

TSVF says:
```
Atom A: ⟨Φₐ| |ψₐ⟩  where ⟨Φₐ| = state that decays at t=1s
Atom B: ⟨Φᵦ| |ψᵦ⟩  where ⟨Φᵦ| = state that decays at t=1000s

They're different from the start! The future distinguishes them.
```

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Time symmetry**: Past and future have equal status
2. **Block universe implied**: Future must exist NOW to affect present
3. **Retrocausality**: Future genuinely influences past
4. **Information theory**: Future carries information not in past

## Experimental Consequences

- Weak measurements reveal pre-existing reality
- Can extract more information than standard QM allows
- Explains phenomena standard QM calls "paradoxes"

---

# EQUATION 2: THE WEAK VALUE (1988)

## The Equation

```
        ⟨Φ|Â|Ψ⟩
Aᵥᵥ = ──────────
        ⟨Φ|Ψ⟩

Where:
- Aᵥᵥ = weak value (new concept!)
- |Ψ⟩ = pre-selected state (before measurement)
- |Φ⟩ = post-selected state (after measurement)
- Â = observable operator
```

## What Existed Before

**Standard QM measurement:**
```
Result ∈ {eigenvalues of Â}

Example: Spin-½ measurement
Result ∈ {-½, +½}  ONLY these values possible
```

Cannot get values outside eigenvalue spectrum.

## What Aharonov Added

**Weak measurement with pre/post-selection:**
```
Result = Aᵥᵥ ∈ ℂ  (all complex numbers!)

Example: Spin-½ weak value
Result can be: 100, -37, 5+2i, anything!
```

Values can be:
- Outside eigenvalue bounds
- Complex numbers (imaginary parts)
- Arbitrarily large

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"Quantum properties are not limited to eigenvalues when measured gently."**

### Physical Meaning:
When you measure weakly (without collapsing wavefunction):
- You can get "impossible" values
- These values are REAL (experimentally observed)
- They reveal deeper reality than standard measurements

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Standard measurement: A → spectrum(Â)  [discrete set]
Weak measurement:     A → ℂ             [entire complex plane]
```

Vastly expanded what "measurement results" can be.

## Concrete Example

**Measuring spin of electron:**

Setup:
```
Prepare: |Ψ⟩ = |↑⟩  (spin up along z)
Post-select: |Φ⟩ = |→⟩  (spin right along x)

Where: |→⟩ = (1/√2)(|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)
```

Calculate weak value of σ̂z (spin along z):
```
⟨Φ|σ̂z|Ψ⟩ = ⟨→|σ̂z|↑⟩ = (1/√2)(⟨↑| + ⟨↓|)·(+ℏ/2)|↑⟩
          = (ℏ/2√2)

⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ = ⟨→|↑⟩ = (1/√2)

(σ̂z)w = (ℏ/2√2)/(1/√2) = ℏ/2
```

But now suppose we post-select nearly orthogonal state:
```
|Φ⟩ = cos(89°)|↑⟩ + sin(89°)|↓⟩ ≈ 0.017|↑⟩ + 0.999|↓⟩

Then: ⟨Φ|σ̂z|Ψ⟩ ≈ 0.017·(ℏ/2)
      ⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ ≈ 0.017

(σ̂z)w ≈ (ℏ/2) ÷ 1 = ℏ/2  (normal)

But at 89.9°: (σ̂z)w ≈ 5ℏ   (5× too big!)
At 89.99°:    (σ̂z)w ≈ 50ℏ  (100× too big!)
At 89.999°:   (σ̂z)w ≈ 500ℏ (1000× too big!)
```

**Standard QM says:** "Spin measurements ONLY give ±ℏ/2"
**Weak values say:** "You can measure 500ℏ if you post-select correctly"

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Amplification**: Tiny effects become huge (useful for precision measurement)
2. **New reality**: Reveals quantum properties between measurements
3. **No disturbance**: Extracts info without collapsing wavefunction
4. **Complex values**: Imaginary parts have physical meaning

## Experimental Verification

**First experiment (Ritchie, Story, Hulet, 1991):**
- Observable with eigenvalues {-1, +1}
- Measured weak value: **-88**
- 88 times larger than maximum eigenvalue!

**Current applications:**
- Ultra-precise measurements (beyond standard quantum limit)
- Detecting tiny signals (gravitational waves, etc.)
- Quantum computing error correction

# EQUATION 3: AHARONOV-BOHM PHASE (1959)

## The Equation

```
         e
φ = ─────── ∮C A·dl
      ℏc

Alternative form:
      e
φ = ─── ΦB
     ℏc

Where:
- φ = phase shift acquired by electron
- e = electron charge
- ℏ = reduced Planck constant
- c = speed of light
- ∮C A·dl = line integral of vector potential around closed path
- ΦB = magnetic flux through enclosed area
```

## What Existed Before

**Standard electromagnetic theory:**
```
Force on particle: F = q(E + v×B)

Only E and B fields have physical effects.
Vector potential A is "just a mathematical tool."
```

Physics depends on fields E and B, not on potential A.

## What Aharonov Added

**Quantum phase depends on A, not B:**
```
Wavefunction: ψ → ψ·exp[iφ]

Where: φ = (e/ℏc)∮A·dl

Even when B = 0 where electron travels!
```

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"The electromagnetic potential A is physically real, not just mathematical."**

### Physical Meaning:
An electron can be affected by a magnetic field **it never touches**:
- Electron travels in region where B = 0
- But acquires phase from A in that region
- A depends on B in distant region (inside solenoid)
- Therefore: Non-local influence

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Classical: Observable = F(E, B)  [local fields]
Quantum:   Observable = F(A, φ)  [global potential]
```

Cannot eliminate A by gauge transformation globally.

## Concrete Example

**Electron interferometer with solenoid:**

Setup:
```
         Path A
        /      \
Electron        Solenoid (B ≠ 0 inside, B = 0 outside)
        \      /
         Path B

Both paths outside solenoid where B = 0
```

Classical prediction:
```
No force on electron (B = 0 where it travels)
No effect on electron
Paths A and B equivalent
```

Quantum (AB effect):
```
Path A acquires phase: φA = (e/ℏc)∫A A·dl
Path B acquires phase: φB = (e/ℏc)∫B A·dl

Phase difference: Δφ = φA - φB = (e/ℏc)∮A·dl = (e/ℏc)ΦB

Result: Interference pattern shifts!
```

**Numerical example:**
```
ΦB = 10⁻¹⁵ Weber (tiny flux)
e/ℏc = 1.5 × 10¹⁵ C/(J·s)

Δφ = (1.5 × 10¹⁵)(10⁻¹⁵) = 1.5 radians ≈ 86°

Observable shift in interference pattern!
```

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Non-locality proven**: Electron affected by distant field
2. **Potentials are real**: A has physical effects, not just E and B
3. **Topology matters**: Effect depends on flux through closed loop (topological invariant)
4. **Gauge theory foundation**: Led to modern understanding of fundamental forces

## The Non-Locality Proof

**Mathematical proof that this is unavoidable:**

Attempt: "Maybe we can gauge away A everywhere outside?"

Try gauge transformation: A → A' = A + ∇χ

To make A' = 0 outside: A = -∇χ

Then for closed loop:
```
∮ A·dl = ∮ (-∇χ)·dl = -[χ(end) - χ(start)]

For closed loop: end = start, so ∮ A·dl = 0
```

But Stokes' theorem says:
```
∮ A·dl = ∫∫(∇×A)·dS = ∫∫B·dS = ΦB ≠ 0
```

**Contradiction!**

Therefore: Cannot gauge away A everywhere outside.

**Conclusion:** Non-locality is **unavoidable** feature of quantum mechanics.

## Experimental History

- **Predicted:** 1959 (Aharonov & Bohm)
- **First observed:** 1960 (Chambers, electron microscopy)
- **Precision tests:** 1980s-1990s (agreement to 0.1%)
- **Current status:** Textbook physics, used in nanotechnology

# EQUATION 4: BACKWARD TIME EVOLUTION (1964)

## The Equation

```
⟨Φ(t)| = ⟨Φ(t₂)|U†(t₂,t)

Where:
- ⟨Φ(t)| = state at time t (t < t₂)
- ⟨Φ(t₂)| = state at later time t₂
- U†(t₂,t) = adjoint of evolution operator
- U†(t₂,t) = exp[+iĤ(t₂-t)/ℏ]  [note PLUS sign]
```

## What Existed Before

**Only forward evolution:**
```
|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t,t₀)|ψ(t₀)⟩
|ψ(t)⟩ = exp[-iĤ(t-t₀)/ℏ]|ψ(t₀)⟩  [MINUS sign]
```

Evolution only goes: Past → Present → Future

## What Aharonov Added

**Backward evolution as physical:**
```
⟨Φ(t)| = ⟨Φ(t₂)|exp[+iĤ(t₂-t)/ℏ]  [PLUS sign]
```

Evolution can go: Future → Present → Past

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"Time can flow backward in quantum mechanics."**

### Physical Meaning:
A measurement outcome at future time t₂ affects:
- What's measurable at present time t
- What was "really there" at past time t₁

This is not just calculation—it's ontological.

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Time parameter can be negative: t → -t
Hamiltonian changes sign: Ĥ → -Ĥ
Evolution reverses direction

Standard QM: e^(-iĤt)  always t > 0
TSVF:       e^(+iĤt)   for t < 0 (backward)
```

## Concrete Example

**Particle decay with post-selection:**

Timeline:
```
t=0: Prepare excited state |Ψ(0)⟩ = |excited⟩
t=?: Particle could decay anytime
t=100s: Post-select "still excited" ⟨Φ| = ⟨excited|
```

Question: What was the decay probability at t=50s?

Standard QM (forward only):
```
P(not decayed at 50s) = |⟨excited|e^(-iĤ·50)|excited⟩|²
                      = e^(-50/τ)  [exponential decay]

Where τ = lifetime
```

TSVF (forward + backward):
```
Forward:  |Ψ(50)⟩ = e^(-iĤ·50)|excited⟩
Backward: ⟨Φ(50)| = ⟨excited|e^(+iĤ·50)

Combined: ⟨Φ(50)|Ψ(50)⟩ = ⟨excited|e^(+iĤ·50)e^(-iĤ·50)|excited⟩
                         = ⟨excited|excited⟩ = 1

P(not decayed | will be excited at 100s) = 1 (certain!)
```

**The future measurement (at t=100) retroactively ensures the past (at t=50).**

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Retrocausality real**: Not just mathematical trick, actual backward influence
2. **Time symmetry**: Physics works same forward and backward
3. **Teleology possible**: Final states can determine intermediate states
4. **Free will compatible**: Future boundary conditions from choices

## Visual Representation

```
Standard QM:
Past ─────→ Present ─────→ Future
 |Ψ₀⟩        |Ψ(t)⟩         ???

TSVF:
Past ←──────┬──────→ Future
 |Ψ₀⟩       ↓        ⟨Φf|
       ⟨Φ(t)|Ψ(t)⟩

Information flows BOTH directions to determine present
```

# EQUATION 5: WEAK MEASUREMENT INTERACTION (1988)

## The Equation

```
Ĥint = λÂsystem ⊗ p̂pointer

Where:
- Ĥint = interaction Hamiltonian
- λ = coupling strength (λ ≪ 1 for "weak")
- Âsystem = observable being measured
- p̂pointer = momentum of measuring device pointer
```

**Resulting pointer shift:**
```
⟨x̂pointer⟩ ≈ λt·Re(Aw)  [to first order in λ]

Where Aw = ⟨Φ|Â|Ψ⟩/⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ is weak value
```

## What Existed Before

**Strong (projective) measurement:**
```
Before: |ψ⟩ = α|a₁⟩ + β|a₂⟩
Measure: A
After:  |ψ⟩ = |aᵢ⟩  [collapsed to eigenstate]
Result: aᵢ  [eigenvalue only]
```

Measurement always:
- Collapses wavefunction
- Disturbs system
- Gives eigenvalue

## What Aharonov Added

**Weak measurement:**
```
Before: |ψ⟩ = α|a₁⟩ + β|a₂⟩
Weak measure: A (with λ ≪ 1)
After:  |ψ⟩ ≈ α|a₁⟩ + β|a₂⟩  [almost unchanged]
Result: Aw  [weak value, can be anything]
```

Weak measurement:
- Does NOT collapse wavefunction
- Does NOT disturb system (negligibly)
- Gives weak value (not eigenvalue)

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"You can look without disturbing—violates Heisenberg's claim."**

### Physical Meaning:
There's a middle ground between:
- Not measuring (no information)
- Measuring (collapse, disturbance)

You can measure "gently" and get information without collapse.

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Coupling strength parameterizes measurement:

λ = 0:        No measurement (no info)
0 < λ ≪ 1:    Weak measurement (weak value)
λ = 1:        Strong measurement (eigenvalue)
```

Continuous spectrum of measurement strengths.

## Concrete Example

**Measuring photon polarization:**

Setup:
```
Photon: |Ψ⟩ = |H⟩  (horizontal polarization)
Measure: σ̂z (polarization along diagonal)
Post-select: |Φ⟩ = |V⟩  (vertical polarization)

Weak value: (σ̂z)w = ⟨V|σ̂z|H⟩/⟨V|H⟩ = 0/0  [undefined!]

Actually, for nearly orthogonal:
⟨V|H⟩ ≈ ε (tiny)
⟨V|σ̂z|H⟩ ≈ ε·(large number)
Result: (σ̂z)w ≈ large
```

Implementation:
```
Weak interaction: Photon shifts position of glass plate slightly
Shift amount: Δx = λ·(σ̂z)w

With λ = 10⁻⁶ and (σ̂z)w = 10⁶:
Δx = 1 mm (easily measurable!)

But individual photon barely affected (shift = 1 nm)
```

**Key point:** Amplification without disturbance.

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Measurement without collapse**: Violates textbook claim
2. **Amplification mechanism**: Weak signals become large
3. **Gentle probing**: Can measure without disturbing
4. **Quantum metrology**: Enables ultra-precise measurements

## Applications

**Quantum metrology:**
- Detecting tiny phase shifts (10⁻⁸ radians)
- Measuring small velocities (10⁻¹⁰ m/s)
- Gravitational wave detection (proposals)

**Quantum computing:**
- Error detection without collapse
- State tomography with minimal disturbance
- Quantum feedback control

**Fundamental physics:**
- Testing quantum foundations
- Resolving quantum paradoxes
- Probing quantum-to-classical transition

# EQUATION 6: PROPERTY SEPARATION (2013)

## The Equation

**Position weak value:**
```
P̂A,w = ⟨Φ|P̂A|Ψ⟩/⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ ≈ 1  [particle in path A]
```

**Spin weak value in path A:**
```
ŜA,w = ⟨Φ|(P̂A⊗σ̂z)|Ψ⟩/⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ ≈ 0  [spin NOT in path A]
```

**Spin weak value in path B:**
```
ŜB,w = ⟨Φ|(P̂B⊗σ̂z)|Ψ⟩/⟨Φ|Ψ⟩ ≈ 1  [spin IS in path B]
```

**Contradiction:** Particle in A, but spin in B!

## What Existed Before

**Standard QM assumption:**
```
Particle properties are POSSESSED by particle.

If particle is at location x, then:
- Its spin is at location x
- Its charge is at location x
- Its mass is at location x

Properties cannot separate from particle.
```

## What Aharonov Added

**Properties can separate:**
```
With specific pre/post-selection:
- Particle location: x₁
- Property location: x₂ ≠ x₁

Properties are independent entities!
```

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"Properties are not possessed—they're independent entities that can separate."**

### Physical Meaning:
The neutron and its spin can:
- Travel separate paths
- Be detected separately
- Reunite later

Like Cheshire Cat (grin without cat).

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Hilbert space factorizes:
H = H_position ⊗ H_property

Standard QM: Always |x⟩|↑⟩ (particle+property together)
Quantum Cheshire: |x₁⟩|elsewhere⟩ + |elsewhere⟩|↑,x₂⟩
                  (particle and property separate)
```

## Concrete Example

**Neutron interferometer:**

Setup:
```
Initial state: |Ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|A⟩|↑⟩ + |B⟩|↓⟩)

Path A: Neutron with spin up
Path B: Neutron with spin down

Magnetic filter in path B flips spin

Post-select: |Φ⟩ = (1/√2)(|A⟩|↑⟩ + |B⟩|↑⟩)
(Both paths have spin up)
```

Weak measurements:
```
Where is neutron?  → Path A (weak value ≈ 1 for path A)
Where is spin up?  → Path B (weak value ≈ 0 for path A)
                             (weak value ≈ 1 for path B)

Neutron travels path A
Spin travels path B
They separate!
```

Physical implementation:
```
To measure "where is neutron": Put weak absorber in path
To measure "where is spin": Put weak magnetic field in path

Results:
- Absorber in A detects neutron
- Magnetic field in B detects spin
- Same neutron, separated property!
```

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Ontology of properties**: Properties exist independently of particles
2. **Wave-particle solved**: Particle has definite location, properties spread out
3. **Quantum weirdness visualized**: Can literally see separation
4. **Measurement problem hint**: Properties behave differently than substances

## Experimental Verification

**Neutron experiment (Denkmayr et al., 2014):**
- Used neutron interferometer
- Measured neutron position weakly
- Measured spin position weakly
- Result: Found in different paths
- Statistical significance: 7σ (extremely certain)

---

# EQUATION 7: NON-LOCAL VARIABLE (Interview description)

## The Equation (Conceptual)

```
Particle has:
- Position: x(t)  [definite, goes through one slit]
- Non-local variable: V(x,t)  [depends on both slits]

Evolution: ∂V/∂t = f(V, A_everywhere)

Where A_everywhere includes potentials in regions particle doesn't visit
```

## What Existed Before

**Wave-particle duality:**
```
Interference requires: Particle is wave, goes through both slits
Which-path info requires: Particle is particle, goes through one slit

Complementarity: Cannot have both simultaneously
```

## What Aharonov Added

**Particle picture with non-local variable:**
```
- Particle is particle (definite position)
- Goes through one slit only
- Has associated variable V that evolves non-locally
- V "knows" about both slits (non-local equations)
- V determines where particle appears on screen
- Result: Interference without being wave
```

## What It Means

### Philosophical Meaning:
**"Wave-particle duality is false—particles have non-local properties."**

### Physical Meaning:
Electron is always particle (has position) but:
- Has another property (V) that evolves non-locally
- V responds to distant configurations
- V guides future behavior
- Creates interference pattern

### Mathematical Meaning:
```
Standard: ψ(x,t) wave function, particle in superposition

Aharonov: x(t) definite position
          V(x,t) non-local variable
          Both required for complete description
```

## Concrete Example

**Double slit with weak measurement:**

Procedure:
```
1. Send electron through double slit
2. Weakly measure which path (don't collapse)
3. Observe interference pattern
4. Post-select on specific pattern
5. Retrospectively determine which path
```

Result:
```
- See interference pattern (standard QM says wave)
- Know which slit (standard QM says impossible)
- Both from same data!

Explanation:
- Particle went through one slit (which-path)
- Variable V evolved knowing both slits (interference)
```

From interview:
> "I can see the interference pattern and nevertheless afterward I can do a measurement that will tell me through which slit the particle went... so must have another explanation for interference not by wave"

## Why It's Revolutionary

1. **Resolves wave-particle duality**: Particle is particle, has non-local property
2. **Explains interference**: Without wave nature
3. **Both/and not either/or**: Position AND interference
4. **Hidden variables**: Not ruled out (but non-local)
