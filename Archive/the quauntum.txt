Here is the full transcript for "The Future Propagates Backward in Quantum Theory" by Curt Jaimungal [[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=0)]:

"[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=0)] how could we have been so wrong for so long about quantum mechanics all the things that we are told\n[[00:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=7)] about quantum mechanics is wrong standard quantum theory describes a wave function that evolves forward from an initial measurement professor\n[[00:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=18)] Yakir Haronoff says this is wrong aharanoff the co-discoverer of the Aharanoff bomb effect and a pioneer of weak measurement\n[[00:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=27)] theory has spent 65 years revolutionizing quantum foundations and this is his first and only time he's given a podcast\n[[00:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=37)] to him quantum reality requires two wave functions one propagating forward from the past and another propagating backward from the\n[[00:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=46)] future this is ABL theory also known as the two-state vector formalism it explains weak measurements which are observations that\n[[00:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=54)] are so gentle they extract information without ever collapsing the wave function and that's why Yakir thinks it's absurd to\n[[01:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=62)] think that the quantum system ever collapses aharov then discovered phenomenons such as quantum cheshire or cat where a neutron\n[[01:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=69)] spin physically separates from the neutron itself and travels independently he's one of the most influential living quantum physicists this\n[[01:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=79)] conversation was filmed directly in his home in Israel and it captures the revolutionary thinking process from the man Heisenberg\n[[01:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=87)] championed whom Bow mentored and whose ideas Fineman called beautiful the professor has a thick accent and I've meticulously transcribed\n[[01:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=95)] and verified every word so please enable subtitles for the optimal viewing experience so sir why don't you tell me\n[[01:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=103)] a bit about how you view the world i told you that I am getting close to really finally understanding\n[[01:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=113)] quantum mechanics you know I've been working for 65 years and struggling all the time to understand better and better\n[[02:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=124)] quantum mechanic while I made progress each time I made some progress in understanding it led to an discovery of\n[[02:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=136)] new phenomena and new effects and that shows that I'm in the right direction and I think I finally arrived\n[[02:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=145)] at a complete new interpretation of quantum mechanics you know that when you have a theory of the world like\n[[02:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=153)] quantum mechanics it's not enough to have just a good mathematical formulation you must have also a story that you\n[[02:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=164)] are able to tell about it that is free of mathematic because the mathematics cannot tell you what questions to\n[[02:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=173)] ask it it can answer any question you ask but it cannot tell you what are the interesting questions to\n[[03:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=180)] ask in order to know what interesting question to ask you must have a way to understand what a theory\n[[03:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=189)] means not in mathematical terms but a new kind of inclusion or story you can tell about it that will\n[[03:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=198)] be as much as possible free of mathematics that story if it's correct can help you to see things in\n[[03:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=207)] the mathematics that otherwise you wouldn't have been able to see so that is the importance of good interpretation so\n[[03:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=216)] the first step is to show that the kind of story that everybody is telling about quantum mechanic is completely\n[[03:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=225)] wrong i will tell you the new the type of story that people usually tell about quantum mechanics they say\n[[03:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=234)] the following thing first of all they say that contrary to classical physics the quantum world is not deterministic that\n[[04:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=244)] means that even if we know everything that we should know about a given system like an atom for example\n[[04:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=252)] we can predict when it will say an emissive photon one atom will emit a photon after one second and\n[[04:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=261)] the other atom which is completely identical and it has exactly the same surrounding will the photo after an hour\n[[04:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=271)] for no reason at all so that is the thing that made Einstein completely angry he said I don't believe\n[[04:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=280)] that God plays dice i don't believe that nature is capricious or unreasonable because we always thought in science that\n[[04:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=290)] everything that happens must have a reason and here for no reason at all one behaves one way and the\n[[04:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=297)] other way so people say about quantum mechanics we simply had to accept it that the world is nondeterministic for\n[[05:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=307)] no reason at all we just had to take it as an exio and my first point is that it's\n[[05:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=314)] not true in fact we can show that just because nature is not deterministic it allows the system the quantum\n[[05:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=323)] system to have properties that it could not have if nature was deterministic so there is a reason for this\n[[05:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=332)] indeterminism as I will describe and once you find the reason for it then it's not anymore that nature is\n[[05:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=341)] capricious it does it for a living reason so that's the first thing that is wrong what people tell us\n[[05:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=350)] about quantum mechanics that for no reason at all the world is nondeterministic there is a reason for it the\n[[05:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=359)] next thing we are told about quantum mechanics or quantum domain is that every measurement that we do on a\n[[06:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=366)] quantum system necessarily disturb it disturb it so much that we cannot say that what we saw what was there\n[[06:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=376)] before because really most of what you see is because of the way that be disturbing so that is completely\n[[06:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=384)] wrong again I have discovered a new kind of measurement that I call nondeter nond disturbing measurements or with measurement\n[[06:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=395)] measurement that don't disturb the system at all and Nevertheless tell us all the information that we need about the\n[[06:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=404)] system provided we can have many examples that we can test so we will discuss it more carefully but the\n[[06:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=413)] idea is that it's not true that there is no reality in the quantum domain there is a reality but\n[[07:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=420)] in order to find it you have to do the right measurement that don't disturb this reality okay that's the\n[[07:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=429)] next thing the last most important thing about we are told about quantum mechanics which is wrong is that a\n[[07:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=436)] quantum particle like electron can be either a particle or a wave they say that the electron for example in\n[[07:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=446)] hydrogen atom is like a wave surrounding the proton not a part rotating around the proton but a wave surrounding\n[[07:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=456)] so with we think about quantum part as there are classical life waves but classical wave has a property that\n[[07:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=467)] if you look at one point on the intensity of this wave you don't change the wave at other places\n[[07:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=474)] but the wave of the electron has the property that if you look at one point and find the electron\n[[08:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=480)] there the whole wave disappear magically and is left only at the place where you found the left one now\n[[08:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=488)] that is an ideological behavior because if a moment before the child of the left and the mass of the\n[[08:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=497)] left were spread all over the way and then you finally find it in one place then all these char\n[[08:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=506)] collaps collapse very quickly to this point that will create a lot of radiation and disturbance that you never see\n[[08:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=514)] so that is not the right description on the other hand people say it must be a weight because there\n[[08:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=521)] is no other way to understand why we see interference on individual electron for example you take electron and send\n[[08:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=531)] it through a screen that has two open splits and if only one of the SL is open and later\n[[08:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=539)] you put a photographic plate and collects one electron after the other you see the pattern that defraction pattern you\n[[09:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=548)] see a spray of points of wave that chain from one if the other is open you see the wave\n[[09:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=556)] that came from the other week but if you open both sides each electron that comes must go through both\n[[09:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=564)] of them in order to explain that you wrote destructive interference that there are points on the photographic stream that\n[[09:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=573)] suddenly no electron appear there if the two switches are open but if only one is open any of them\n[[09:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=581)] it will appear there so people say because of that there is no way to understand that behavior and if\n[[09:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=588)] we say the direction also can be awake and I will show this in episode two by doing the kind\n[[09:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=597)] of new experiment that I'm talking about i can see the interference pattern and nevertheless afterward I can do a\n[[10:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=607)] measurement that will tell me through which sleep the particle went so he must have another explanation for interference nor\n[[10:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=617)] by weight and I found that interpretation in fact I found that interpretation of by of this new behavior already\n[[10:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=629)] in the 60s in 1964 I came to Munich and I visited Msplank Institute and I was introduced to Heisenber\n[[10:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=643)] who was alive there yes few more years after that he was alive and then when I entered to his\n[[10:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=651)] room and we were introduced I asked Professor Heisenberg do you know how to explain interference in your language because\n[[11:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=661)] the language of Heisenberg by was a language that was still use of position and momentum and the dynamics that\n[[11:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=672)] a new dynamics that correspond to matrices instead of usual variables so the that was the dynamics that's called noncommuting\n[[11:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=683)] dynamics so anyhow I asked him neurodynamics do you know how to explain the interference he said he doesn't know\n[[11:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=693)] so I showed him my new way to think about it and he got so excited that from then on\n[[11:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=699)] anyone that came to visit him I was told by his assistants Peter Doo that the finger will take him\n[[11:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=707)] to a black boat and show him how to understand the interference in his pistol so the way that I\n[[11:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=715)] think about interference is by showing that in quantum mechanics there are the basic equations of motion or equations of\n[[12:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=725)] motion are non local the electron even though it moves at one point has another variable that will tell the\n[[12:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=736)] electron later where to appear on the photographic plate and that variable has non local equations of motion so although\n[[12:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=746)] the electron goes through one street that variable knows if the other is open or not because there are non-local\n[[12:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=754)] equations of motion and at first you think if there are non local equations of motion something terrible can happen\n[[12:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=763)] because it will destroy causality the party goes for one slit you open the other slit and instantaneously that variable\n[[12:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=773)] knows that the other slit is opened so that way that quantum mechanics gets out of this problem is by\n[[13:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=782)] having the uncertainties that uh if you know from the path so which field the patter has the non equation\n[[13:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=793)] of motion is completely uncertain but if you use pre and post selection you can prepare initially the particle that\n[[13:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=802)] you don't know through which phys it goes you then check the interference pattern by looking by looking on it\n[[13:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=812)] with big measurement and do this on some so you don't disturb any of the particles and then after you\n[[13:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=819)] see that interference by with measurement you can check through which the particle went and that will set your proposality\n[[13:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=829)] and you can see that the new thing about quantum mechanics is the normal quality that is allowed only before\n[[13:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=838)] you have uncertainties that's a very southern point okay so we to summarize the all the things that we are\n[[14:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=847)] told in quantum mechanics is wrong i I writing now article that I say I call it how could we\n[[14:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=856)] have been so wrong for so long about quer mechanics all the things that we have been told telling about\n[[14:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=864)] quantum mechanics to many the streets look quality is such a mysterious theory the problem can be at the same\n[[14:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=873)] time at two different location right there is no reality there there is no reason there because two atoms for\n[[14:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=881)] no reason behave differently so the world according to this story is so illogical that people philosophers and writers now\n[[14:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=893)] say that the whole we have to look at the world as something completely uncertain because that is what quantum\n[[15:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=900)] mechanics tell us about and that story is wrong okay so this is my main mission to show that the\n[[15:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=909)] way that we have thought about quantum mechanics is really wrong and we have to think about it in new\n[[15:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=915)] way now once you think about it in this new way and you learn to look at quantum system without\n[[15:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=922)] disturbing them you find a beautiful new reality that can be checked only by this kind of measurement and I\n[[15:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=931)] found a host host of new phenomena that is related to this reality the perhaps the most entertaining phenomena is\n[[15:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=943)] that I call the quantum cheshure that's it you know the story about Ellis and Wonderland that was written by\n[[15:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=954)] right and this Ellis comes to this beautiful world she can talk to animals there and she met a cat\n[[16:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=962)] she talked to the cat and after a while the cat gets angry and disappears but it disappears in a\n[[16:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=971)] very strange way first that tail disappears then the body disappears then the face disappears and only a smile is\n[[16:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=980)] left and Alice thinks to herself that many times seems ahead without a smile but what could be a smile\n[[16:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=990)] without a fat doesn't make sense so everybody that reads this including me when I read it in high school\n[[16:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=998)] I thought that the new Le was crazy to talk about a smile without the head but it turns out\n[[16:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1006)] that one of me tells us that that can really happen what I have shown is there is a very\n[[16:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1012)] interesting effect you take a particle like a neutron that has a property that's called a spin the neutron can\n[[17:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1021)] rotate around itself and produce a magnetic moment that rotation is called a spin and it turns out that it's\n[[17:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1030)] possible to do an experiment where you send the electron in one side and the spin leaves the electron and\n[[17:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1039)] moves by itself on the other side and then they join again so the spin is like the smile of\n[[17:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1046)] the head that can leave the neutron although everybody thought this the neutral can never be exist without the spin\n[[17:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1055)] and the spin can always exist without the neutral this is one of the kind of new phenomena that I\n[[17:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1063)] found once I started to sing correctly by using prection and there are many many other effects that something called\n[[17:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1073)] super oscillations and quantum work that are new directional mathematics just came out of this world and there are many\n[[18:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1082)] other beautiful results especially that when you have an electron when you do pre selection you find that the electron\n[[18:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1093)] can have together with it a a pair of another electron and a counter electron that has a negative mass\n[[18:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1105)] and the opposite charge and if you only do with measurement you see those new kind of of entities that\n[[18:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1114)] I call quantum counter particles so there are beautiful new phenomena that you discover once you see proper quantum mechanic\n[[18:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1126)] so the first idea is when you have two atoms that are exactly the same but they behave later differently\n[[18:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1135)] you say that this later experiment tells you that in fact from the beginning the two atoms were different but\n[[19:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1144)] you couldn't find it in the past you can only find it in the future and I reformulated quantum mechanics\n[[19:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1151)] by saying that in order to describe the present in classical physics to describe fully the present it's enough to\n[[19:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1160)] know the initial conditions in the past and quan is in order to describe fully the pattern in the present\n[[19:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1169)] you must do two experiment one before that give you a one boundary condition the past the wave function that\n[[19:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1178)] you found before propagates to the present and later you do another experiment that gets different results for one estimate\n[[19:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1189)] the other that different result give you another boundary from this one and that new thing that is thrown away\n[[19:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1197)] is propagated back from the future to the present and both information from the past and from the future which\n[[20:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1207)] can happen only quantum mechanically because radically once you know the past there is no new information in the future\n[[20:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1215)] but in quantum mechanics you have new information in the future and both informations are re relevant in the present\n[[20:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1224)] provided you do only with measurement to tell them okay that is uh in a nutshell the ideas that I\n[[20:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1234)] want to discuss in this interview so that's perfect the Economist covers math physics philosophy and AI in a manner\n[[20:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1242)] that shows how different countries perceive developments and how they impact markets they recently published a piece on China's new\n[[20:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1248)] nutrino detector they cover extending life via mitochondrial transplants creating an entirely new field of medicine but it's also not\n[[20:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1257)] just science they analyze culture they analyze finance economics business international affairs across every region i'm particularly liking their new\n[[21:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1265)] insider feature it was just launched this month it gives you it gives me a front row access to the\n[[21:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1271)] economist's internal editorial debates where senior editors argue through the news with world leaders and policy makers in twice

specifying\n[[21:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1308)] right now the two-state vector formalism yes and quant mechanics is described by a vector in space uh uh that\n[[21:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1317)] is that that vector in the s presentation is described by a wave and the other representation is described by\n[[22:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1326)] some observable that tell you what this vector is but anyhow the other vector that comes from the measurement in\n[[22:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1334)] the past it propagate according to the Heisman of M to the present then later you do another experiment that\n[[22:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1348)] distinguish between the two particle that started in the same initial condition one of them moves to the right and\n[[22:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1356)] the other move to the left if you take only those that move to the right it gives you another\n[[22:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1362)] boundary condition another vector that will send it back from the future to the present and both vectors on equal\n[[22:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1371)] terms tells you the true information about the present that is called the two vector formulation that I did discover\n[[23:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1381)] in the early 60s okay yes what I'm wondering sir and I would like to get to some historical stories\n[[23:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1391)] with Bow and with Heisenberg and so forth but what I'm wondering right now is when we were speaking off\n[[23:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1397)] air you were referencing that you have to tell the history the history how I met B sure and how\n[[23:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1405)] we did work together i studied a detection in higher in the science faculty and I got a course I\n[[23:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1417)] was taught quant mechanics by the famous Nathan Rosen you know the famous artiful Rosen one of the most famous\n[[23:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1428)] artist in history Rosen is that Rosen and he taught me quantum mechanics beautiful course at the end of the\n[[23:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1435)] course where And each one of the student was supposed to write a final short thesis on any subject as\n[[24:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1446)] he wants to choose in order to get the grade for the host and we were supposed to come to\n[[24:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1453)] to professor Rosen attending what we decided to welcome for this ex so I came to his office and said\n[[24:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1462)] "Professor Rosen I would like to work on the quantum theory of measurement." He say no no no that that\n[[24:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1471)] subject is only for very old people like me you should do some proper physics world like something in sol\n[[24:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1479)] state or something that is real down to earth physics and not this philosophy about measurement theory you know people\n[[24:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1487)] waste all people waste their time nobody will understand it anyhow and I told Professor Oen look the only reason\n[[24:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1495)] I decided to study physics is because I was interested in foundational problems and that's why I I want to\n[[25:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1504)] work on it he said "No no you will waste your time." So we we had this impass and I\n[[25:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1512)] went out to the corridor with long face and I met an assistant by the name of Y they told\n[[25:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1520)] me when heard what happened look there is a new professor that just arrived in the techn by the name\n[[25:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1527)] of David Bomb go to his office maybe he will help you so I came to his office entered to\n[[25:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1535)] the office and introduced myself telling told him about my problem with Rosen and he asked me what do you\n[[25:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1542)] want to to what are you saying about so I told him the kind of problem and interest me said\n[[25:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1548)] okay it interest me to you will work with me I will tell them that you will be now my\n[[25:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1556)] student and that's how we started to interact together after one hero he had to leave Israel he went to\n[[26:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1564)] England to Bristol and I came along with him that's where I did my PhD that's where I discovered the\n[[26:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1573)] the thing that's called our role of bomb effect and that was a beautiful thing that happened due to marty\n[[26:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1581)] I I think the only good thing that happened from marti was the fact that bomb had to leave United\n[[26:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1588)] States because princip was very concerned that Bomb is called to testify in front of the Madi committee they immediately\n[[26:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1599)] decided to fire him not to tenure and then he had to leave United States he went to Brazil and\n[[26:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1608)] then when he was in Brazil he was called by the committee to come back and testify about the trial\n[[26:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1616)] of Openheimer and B refused to do it so they took his passport and they removed his citizenship so he\n[[27:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1626)] couldn't come back to United States and that's why why decided to come to Tan Hifa so that's the only\n[[27:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1634)] good thing that happened from Mac okay that's how I met Bow so that was the the inter the initial\n[[27:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1642)] let me see if I got this timeline correct you collaborated with Bowen to come up with the Aaronov Bow\n[[27:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1651)] effect yes okay that was toward the end of the 1950s and then in the 60s you articulated your two-state\n[[27:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1659)] vector formalism yeah that was after I I finished my PhD with B at Bristol i went from one for\n[[27:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1668)] one year to Bes University as a sales associate and then I I came as a assistant professor to university\n[[27:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1679)] in New York and when I was there at that time it was a very good uh uh phys department\n[[28:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1688)] that was labor vit time and and Peter Bman who was the assistant of Einstein was a vi professor there\n[[28:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1700)] and while I was there I started to think about the idea of that the future vector is also relevant\n[[28:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1709)] i told him to I told it to be ber and neighbor and they wrote a cited and that's how\n[[28:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1715)] we wrote this article that's called now the for that was in 1961 or 62\n[[28:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1725)] what was bow like personally oh like a beautiful person was extremely intelligent but I think he was affected very\n[[28:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1738)] badly by the um by what happened to him at Princeton and that is what caused him later to devote\n[[29:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1748)] most of his time to work that was not really proper physics i mean it became more and more philosophical\n[[29:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1756)] but when I interacted with him he was still really extremely brilliant in fact he was I told that he\n[[29:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1768)] that he look at B as his real follower of and Fman when we wrote the article of the AB\n[[29:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1782)] Fman sent us back a cable saying how beautiful how come I had not thought about it myself so and\n[[29:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1794)] uh Fman said also about Bum that he was the only one that he knows that was smarter than him\n[[30:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1802)] so B was really extremely smart but very kind person and it was rather beautiful experience to work with him\n[[30:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1812)] that's rare of Fineman to admit fin told it to someone I don't have to whom that the only person\n[[30:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1819)] that he met that was smarter than him was boom tell me about what line of thinking led to the\n[[30:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1825)] Aronoff bow effect what led us to the work what led us to the idea yes yes that you can\n[[30:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1832)] shift the electrons quantum phase and so you can have global gauge features that not just local forces those local\n[[30:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1840)] gauge features must be taken as physically real i can tell you how I tend to think about this idea\n[[30:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1847)] that led to the whole of I I was excited when a graduate student when I learned about blows that\n[[31:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1860)] showed that if you have a periodic potential in space like in crystal then you have a something that is\n[[31:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1870)] very interesting that you develop a gap in energy because the particle the periodic potential makes a particle with positive\n[[31:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1880)] momentum jumps from negative momentum and the superp position give you a gap in energy so when I thought about\n[[31:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1888)] it I thought why don't I try to do the same thing not in space but in time i will\n[[31:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1896)] take a periodic potential in time and maybe then I will get a gap in momentum because if I change\n[[31:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1904)] position to time I have to change energy to momentum and luckily I did not know anything about gformation I\n[[31:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1913)] was if I knew about G transformation I would know that periodic potential in time cannot do anything but I\n[[32:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1922)] did not know about it so I started to calculate Okay and I saw to my dismay that the only\n[[32:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1929)] thing that happen when you put a periodic function of time is that you change the size of the wave\n[[32:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1936)] function that doesn't lead to any observab but then it occurred to me that if I will put one potential\n[[32:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1946)] in one place and a different potential time dependent potential in another place then I will get a different phase\n[[32:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1955)] and that different phase can be observed so I thought about an idea that I have two farad stages and\n[[32:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1963)] the lesson can be either in one of them or in the other when it's inside the paradise shade it's\n[[32:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1970)] completely protected against any electric fields outside because it cannot penetrate the exchange the only thing that plate can penetrate\n[[33:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1984)] is time dependent potential so I have different time dependent potential in one far exchange and another in the other\n[[33:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=1992)] far exchange that will produce a different phase and then I can open the fire exes after I remove the\n[[33:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2003)] electric field outside the lesson will go out and interfere and that interference will show that there was an electric\n[[33:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2012)] film between the two fares and the lesson did not touch that that electric field but it's still felting it\n[[33:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2021)] so that was the beginning i went to B and told him about this idea and he said that's very\n[[33:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2027)] interesting and he came out with the modification and said the father page the thing that appears in our article\n[[33:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2037)] is too long cylinders conducting dirt but let's say for a while we hadn't published it yet and then I\n[[34:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2049)] went to a summer school at world where they talked a lot about at that time the thing the such\n[[34:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2062)] in physics was a terrible time when you had infinities of direction magnetic field people did not know what to\n[[34:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2070)] do it sober suggested that instead we have to talk only about scattering or asmmetric and then there was a\n[[34:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2079)] whole mathematics around it from dispel social relation and the whole physics at that time was horrible just of mathematics\n[[34:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2088)] but anyhow I wanted to find out what it's all about and when I was there at they discussed also\n[[34:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2096)] the effect not only of cell potential but also of electro potential and then it occurred to me that maybe\n[[35:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2104)] we can generalize the thing that I talked about the two cases for the case where I have a magnetic\n[[35:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2112)] field in the middle and vector of potent vector of potential on both sides i haven't told that about B\n[[35:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2120)] to bomb and then I really got excited and he said okay if you are able to solve the problem\n[[35:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2127)] of infinite line of flux uh and see what happened to in that phase we publish the article and that\n[[35:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2137)] was the the way that it came about and I remember that at that time there was in England there\n[[35:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2145)] was the fashion to have He at 4:00 in the afternoon where graded students and professors at Bristol were sitting\n[[35:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2154)] together and I told everybody about this idea i said nobody could do the experiment because the electron has such\n[[36:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2163)] a small wavelength that if it has to go around a solenoid a microscopic solenoid there would be no stable\n[[36:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2171)] way to see the interference and there was a professor there by the name of Sir Fran who said wait\n[[36:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2179)] I know what you can do if you have a single magnetic whis that's like a small thin magnetic flag\n[[36:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2190)] that goes inside the first line you can do the experiment around this magnetic whis and chambers was a professor\n[[36:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2201)] experimental professor that in this meeting said I am going to do this experiment and that was the beginning of\n[[36:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2208)] the experiment that well from the roller bomb now it's very interesting that when we published the article and price\n[[36:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2219)] who was the chairman of the department Bristol went to visit max institute and he came back and said that\n[[37:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2229)] n doesn't believe that the effect is correct in fact many people could not believe that the effect is right\n[[37:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2238)] but later the son of B finally convince him that the effect is for real and of course even today\n[[37:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2246)] there are still some people that think that something is wrong with the effect because it looks very strange that\n[[37:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2253)] the particle can feel the potential and all the force but that's certainly a true quantum effect that was the\n[[37:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2263)] first occasion where I realized that the basic equations in quantum mechanism must be non local the Rasm equation because\n[[37:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2275)] the force affect nonoperally the particle that is at the distance away so that was the beginning of my thinking\n[[38:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2284)] about non-orality and quantum mechanics can you explain how you see what gauge theory is to people who aren't physicists\n[[38:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2292)] but also just keep in mind that many physicists watch this program professors of physics researchers postocs and so forth\n[[38:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2301)] so you can also explain to them how you see gauge theory\n[[38:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2307)] first of all all the interaction that we know in nature the electromagnetic interaction the storm interaction and the the\n[[38:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2316)] wave interaction and the gravitation all of them are described by potentials now and but that potential because then the\n[[38:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2329)] the locally they are not observed they must have some freedom that you can change in them without changing the\n[[38:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2337)] physics now why do you need potentials it turns out if you insist and physics it was known that you\n[[39:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2346)] can formulate this in two ways other you use the Newton equation of motion which just uses forces then can\n[[39:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2355)] Hamilton and show that you can also right of physics by using Hamiltonian and using the am equation of motion\n[[39:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2369)] and for that you need potential so in order to be able to describe forces in the harmonical language by\n[[39:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2379)] using Hamiltonian you must have potentials but the potentials had the property that they have a freedom you can change\n[[39:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2390)] the potential without changing the forces that freedom is called great transformation but potentials are necessary if you want to\n[[40:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2400)] formulate new even classically new equation of motion by using\n[[40:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2409)] but I'mian you must use potential\n[[40:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2415)] why is it that you're saying that the Aronov bomb effect indicates that reality or nature is non-local because I\n[[40:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2425)] believe that the fact that you write a local local equation by using potentials that is misleading because suppose I\n[[40:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2439)] say the lon moves only on one side and there is a vector potential there and it's affected by this\n[[40:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2448)] vector potential but I can use g transformation If we completely make this vector potential on one side zero and\n[[40:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2458)] nevertheless the electron still affects the force so the fact that we can use it like a local equation is\n[[41:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2470)] misleading because we can always move by transformation remove the potential from the region where the party is moving and\n[[41:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2480)] the party is still feel the effects of the force finally so there is no way to describe really the\n[[41:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2489)] effects of the force locally it's a mathematical formulation that uses waves but both the waves are not real and\n[[41:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2497)] the potentials are not real the only thing that you can really observe are the forces and the the idea\n[[41:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2506)] that we describe directly by weight as I shown is misleading you have to describe it by a particle that\n[[41:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2514)] moves only on one side but it feels longer with the force you just mentioned that the waves are not\n[[42:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2522)] real and the potential is not real so in your mind what is real what is ontologically there in physical\n[[42:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2531)] reality i I think that if you think about the way that phys that father me started that was first\n[[42:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2542)] the Heiser approach before shar and Heisenberg described physics still by using position and momentum as the fundamental concepts but\n[[42:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2557)] he said that instead of using the position momentum as uh numbers I have to use them as matrices and\n[[42:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2567)] he wrote the equations of motion for these matrices but it turns out that it was very complicated to solve\n[[42:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2576)] the Heisenberg equations of motion people could do it for harmonic oscillator and for hand of the but the minute\n[[43:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2584)] they try to solve the heisenberation of motion for something more complicated like an with two electrons or any other\n[[43:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2594)] narcot then came following the body idea that electrons could also be waves and wrote a very simple wave equation\n[[43:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2607)] describing the electron form and that wave equation it's called the shredding equation was extremely simple to solve and then\n[[43:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2616)] there you could very quickly solve much more complicated problems and then people old people left Heisenberg and went to\n[[43:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2626)] shreddinger equations and say that is the right physics and poor Eisenberg was fing all the time that could not\n[[43:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2634)] be true that is not what mechanics is about nobody listen to him people say that look must be waved\n[[44:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2644)] we see interference we have the shredding a picture that's so nice and I think now that the shredding a\n[[44:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2652)] picture is only a mathematical way to solve the Heisenberg faces of motion you've solved what happened to the phantom\n[[44:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2662)] vector presentation but for me the the wave is like potential it's not it's like a mathematical aid to solve\n[[44:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2673)] the problem but it does not show what is really there and what is really there are observables that are\n[[44:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2682)] function of position momentum and you can follow what happened to those observables if you know how to solve the\n[[44:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2689)] various equations of moment so the ple even qu still had to be described by a point you don't know\n[[44:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2699)] where it is but then you even find it moves very disorderly but you can find a way to see\n[[45:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2710)] the property of what happened with posture then you can see indirectly what is called the wave which you have\n[[45:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2721)] many many particles that are described by the same state then you can actually observe on the average of these\n[[45:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2730)] particles the the the wave but the wave is only a pro an average property of many particles not of\n[[45:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2738)] which the one did you ever try to make a gravitational version of the aronoff bomb effect yes definitely with\n[[45:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2748)] my first case this student We wrote analog of the AB effect both for the young theory non ges and\n[[45:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2759)] for gravitational z but later people made a lot of other modification by the way there is a very interesting\n[[46:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2769)] historical story apart from the one I told you that Yan the one that got the Nobel Prize together with\n[[46:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2778)] Lee and Yang he did welcome the Arono bomb effect and he continue he showed explain by using the ABS\n[[46:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2789)] effect to explain why flux inside superconductor must be quantized but each time we refer to our own bulb\n[[46:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2803)] so one time I met him in Japan i came to conference there asked him that why do you call\n[[46:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2809)] it the Bono he said oh of course because he was your the advisor must have been his idea i\n[[46:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2818)] said no it was my idea so he said look if you want me to refer to it differently ask\n[[47:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2826)] David B to write me a letter in which he will state that it was actually your idea interesting so\n[[47:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2833)] I sent to David B told him what happened and he wrote a letter to Yan and then Yan sent\n[[47:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2839)] me a letter saying okay from now on I will start to call the owner of B because that's what\n[[47:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2847)] B testify his letter I have this letter from Yan wrote a letter to CN stating that in fact the\n[[47:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2857)] first idea of the ABF was mine and he only had me better to um perform is better and then\n[[47:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2868)] from then on Young started to call it the Bonov you mean he then started to call it the Aronov\n[[47:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2874)] bomb effect yeah bomb effect right right send me a letter saying that indeed confirmed that it was my idea\n[[48:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2886)] at this point we were having so many internet connection issues that we decided it was better to stop here\n[[48:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2892)] especially since Yakir wants to hear from you answer your questions so this is part one part two will be\n[[48:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQT1HrM63ZE&t=2898)] coming out in a few weeks leave any questions in the comments section below and of course subscribe to
